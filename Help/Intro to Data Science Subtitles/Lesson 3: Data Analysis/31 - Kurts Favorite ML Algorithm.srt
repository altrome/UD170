1
00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:04,510
Sure, sure. That's a great question. So I would say, you

2
00:00:04,510 --> 00:00:06,510
know, just as a, as a caveat, that really depends a

3
00:00:06,510 --> 00:00:09,490
lot of the type of problems any given data scientists are

4
00:00:09,490 --> 00:00:13,170
working on, the type of questions you're, you're looking at. For me

5
00:00:13,170 --> 00:00:15,420
personally, a lot of the questions that, that I look at

6
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:18,420
and a lot of the things that interest me, tend to

7
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:22,580
be fairly high level and somewhat loosely defined and I mentioned,

8
00:00:22,580 --> 00:00:25,480
looking a lot more at the social aspects of how people use

9
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:28,740
social networks. And a lot of topics like

10
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:31,390
that, sometimes the most useful thing is really

11
00:00:31,390 --> 00:00:34,170
to just get a broad and qualitative understanding

12
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:36,890
of, of the data you're looking at. So,

13
00:00:36,890 --> 00:00:38,630
two of the most valuable techniques I found

14
00:00:38,630 --> 00:00:41,350
for that are clustering. There are various approaches,

15
00:00:41,350 --> 00:00:46,510
kamines, clustering, hierarchical clustering. And then other dimensionality

16
00:00:46,510 --> 00:00:50,360
reduction techniques or things like principle component analysis, PCA.

17
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:52,620
One, one thing, just speaking very specifically that

18
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:55,220
I found very useful is the combination of

19
00:00:55,220 --> 00:00:57,530
kamines, clustering and PCA. So if, if you

20
00:00:57,530 --> 00:01:00,280
generate clusters and then use PCA to take the

21
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:04,110
most, meaningful vectors to plot those clusters on,

22
00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:05,760
you can often do a really nice job of

23
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:09,460
reducing dimensionality of a data set and understanding,

24
00:01:09,460 --> 00:01:12,100
the significant differences between clusters in a visual way.
