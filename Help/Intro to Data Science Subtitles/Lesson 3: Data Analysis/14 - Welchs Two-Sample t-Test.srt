1
00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:03,170
Let's talk more about the two sample t-test, since we'll want

2
00:00:03,170 --> 00:00:06,880
to compare two different samples in our class project. There are

3
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:09,455
a few different versions of the t-test that one might employ

4
00:00:09,455 --> 00:00:12,580
,and they depend on really on what assumptions we make about the

5
00:00:12,580 --> 00:00:15,680
data. So we might want to ask questions such as ,do our

6
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:18,290
samples have the same size ?,and do they have the same

7
00:00:18,290 --> 00:00:21,831
variance? . Let's discuss a variant of the t-test called Welch's

8
00:00:21,831 --> 00:00:25,686
t-test in more depth. Since it's the most general. It doesn't assume

9
00:00:25,686 --> 00:00:28,498
equal sample size ,or equal variance. In Welch's

10
00:00:28,498 --> 00:00:33,510
t-test ,we compute a t-statistic using following equation.

11
00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:36,950
T equals mu1 minus mu2, divided by the

12
00:00:36,950 --> 00:00:40,260
square root of sigma1 squared over n1. Plus

13
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:45,950
sigma 2 squared over n2. Where mu I ,is the sample mean for the Ith sample.

14
00:00:45,950 --> 00:00:48,150
Sigma squared I is the sample variance for

15
00:00:48,150 --> 00:00:51,010
the Ith sample. And NI is the sample size

16
00:00:51,010 --> 00:00:54,410
for the Ith sample. We'll also want to estimate the number of degrees

17
00:00:54,410 --> 00:00:57,200
of freedom, nu, using the following equation.

18
00:00:58,380 --> 00:01:02,315
Nu is approximately equal to. Quantity sigma1

19
00:01:02,315 --> 00:01:08,911
squared ,over n1 ,plus sigma2 squared over n2 ,squared over sigma1 of the

20
00:01:08,911 --> 00:01:16,220
4th over n1 squared nu1 ,plus sigma2 to the 4th ,over n2 squared nu2.

21
00:01:16,220 --> 00:01:19,390
Where mu I is equal to mi minus one ,and

22
00:01:19,390 --> 00:01:22,320
this is the degrees of freedom associated with the Ith variance

23
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:25,560
estimate. If you're unfamiliar with degrees of freedom again it might

24
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:27,620
be a good idea to brush up on your stats concepts

25
00:01:27,620 --> 00:01:30,510
with the audacity's intro to stats course. A link is

26
00:01:30,510 --> 00:01:33,550
provided in the instructor comments. All right so once we have

27
00:01:33,550 --> 00:01:37,372
these two values, we can estimate the P value. Conceptually, the

28
00:01:37,372 --> 00:01:41,420
P-value is the probability of obtaining the test statistic at least

29
00:01:41,420 --> 00:01:43,835
as extreme as the one that was actually observed

30
00:01:43,835 --> 00:01:47,562
,assuming that the null hypothesis was true. The P

31
00:01:47,562 --> 00:01:50,630
value is not the probability of the null hypothesis

32
00:01:50,630 --> 00:01:53,570
is true given the data. So again, just as a

33
00:01:53,570 --> 00:01:56,090
thought experiment. Say we were testing whether left handed

34
00:01:56,090 --> 00:01:59,196
or right handed baseball players. Were better batters by looking

35
00:01:59,196 --> 00:02:03,040
at their average batting average. If the P value

36
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:06,440
is .05, this would mean that ,even if there is

37
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:09,320
no difference between left handed and right handed batters, since

38
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:12,590
that's our null hypothesis. So, even if this was true,

39
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:15,570
we would see a value of t ,equal or greater

40
00:02:15,570 --> 00:02:18,320
to the one that we saw 5% of the time.

41
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:21,420
When performing a statistical test like this, we usually set

42
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:25,200
some critical value of P. Let's call it P critical.

43
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:27,910
If P falls below P critical, then we would reject

44
00:02:27,910 --> 00:02:31,440
the null hypothesis. In the two sample case, this is equivalent

45
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:33,270
to stating that the mean for our two samples

46
00:02:33,270 --> 00:02:36,260
is not equal. Calculating this P value for a

47
00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:39,070
given set of data can be kind of of tedious.

48
00:02:39,070 --> 00:02:42,390
Thankfully, we seldom have to perform this calculation explicitly.
