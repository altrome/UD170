Let's say that we wanted to compare the batting averages

0:00:03.120,0:00:06.880
of left handed and right handed hitters in major league baseball.

0:00:06.880,0:00:10.150
So we're curious in answering the question, is there any difference

0:00:10.150,0:00:13.770
between the batting averages of lefties and righties? We could just

0:00:13.770,0:00:15.950
look at the data and try to answer this question without

0:00:15.950,0:00:18.990
a significance test. But then we really couldn't trust our answer

0:00:18.990,0:00:22.140
very much. It's a much better idea to answer this question

0:00:22.140,0:00:26.070
using a statistical test. Many statistical tests that you might use

0:00:26.070,0:00:29.190
to analyze data make an assumption about the probability distribution

0:00:29.190,0:00:32.570
that your data will follow. There are many different probability distributions

0:00:32.570,0:00:34.860
out there, but one of the most common and the

0:00:34.860,0:00:38.030
one that I want to discuss is the normal distribution, which

0:00:38.030,0:00:41.100
is also sometimes referred to as the Gaussian distribution or

0:00:41.100,0:00:45.050
a Bell curve. If you've taken an introduction to statistics course,

0:00:45.050,0:00:48.430
the normal distribution should be familiar. Which of the images below

0:00:48.430,0:00:51.720
depicts a normal distribution? Check the box below the correct one.
