1
00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:02,340
These have just been some of the methods that we

2
00:00:02,340 --> 00:00:05,880
can use when performing statistical tests on data. As you

3
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:08,109
can imagine, there are a number of additional ways to

4
00:00:08,109 --> 00:00:11,820
handle data from different probability distributions or data that looks

5
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:15,560
like it came from no probability distribution whatsoever. Data scientists

6
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:19,190
can perform many statistical procedures. But it's vital to understand

7
00:00:19,190 --> 00:00:22,980
the underlying structure of the data set and consequently, which

8
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:26,440
statistical tests are appropriate given the data that we have.

9
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:29,530
There are many different types of statistical tests and even many

10
00:00:29,530 --> 00:00:31,460
different schools of thought within statistics

11
00:00:31,460 --> 00:00:32,870
regarding the correct way to analyze

12
00:00:32,870 --> 00:00:35,640
data. This has really just been an opportunity to get your

13
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:38,884
feet wet with statistical analysis. It's just the tip of the iceberg.
