00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:02,330
All right. Why don't we try computing these

2
00:00:02,330 --> 00:00:06,280
two quantities, t and nu, given some example batting

3
00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:08,640
average data. So, let's say that I had

4
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:13,210
two samples. One with 150 data points, a mean

5
00:00:13,210 --> 00:00:16,325
batting average of 0.299, and a variance of

6
00:00:16,325 --> 00:00:19,616
0.05. The other has 165 data points, and mean

7
00:00:19,616 --> 00:00:23,830
of 0.307, and a variance of 0.08. What are

8
00:00:23,830 --> 00:00:26,530
the values of t and nu given this data?

9
00:00:26,530 --> 00:00:27,840
Fill in your answers in these boxes

10
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:29,970
below, and round them to three decimal places.
