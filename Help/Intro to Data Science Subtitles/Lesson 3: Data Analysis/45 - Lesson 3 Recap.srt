00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:03,240
In this lesson, we are discussing basics, statistics and

2
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:05,500
machine learning methods that you can use to analyze your

3
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:10,100
data. Not only can we draw conclusions that are statistically

4
00:00:10,100 --> 00:00:13,040
sound about existing data, we can also make predictions about

5
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:16,300
the data that we might collect in the future. During

6
00:00:16,300 --> 00:00:18,520
this lesson, we have chosen to really zero in on

7
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:23,080
a couple of methods. Specifically Welsh's T-test and linear regression

8
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:25,850
with gradient descent, but as you can imagine, this is

9
00:00:25,850 --> 00:00:28,258
just the tip of the iceberg. There are tons of

10
00:00:28,258 --> 00:00:32,250
statistics and machine learning techniques out there. If you're interested, I

11
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:34,440
would really encourage you to go out there and read more

12
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:37,930
about those stats and machine learning. Now that you're familiar with

13
00:00:37,930 --> 00:00:41,060
these statistics and machine learning techniques, you'll use them to

14
00:00:41,060 --> 00:00:44,150
make predictions about subway ridership in New York and also to

15
00:00:44,150 --> 00:00:46,950
draw some conclusions about the existing subway data that we have.

16
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:50,870
Once you have made these conclusions and predictions you might find

17
00:00:50,870 --> 00:00:53,920
that you'd really love to communicate them to other people.

18
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:57,160
Be they your friends, or your teachers, or your family.

19
00:00:57,160 --> 00:00:58,900
One of the most effective ways to do that is

20
00:00:58,900 --> 00:01:02,120
through data visualization. That's what we'll cover in the next lesson.
