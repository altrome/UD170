00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:03,346
Okay, why is machine learning useful? So that's, that, that's

2
00:00:03,346 --> 00:00:05,986
a great question and, and it, you know, I, I think

3
00:00:05,986 --> 00:00:08,746
it touches on this, this sort of classic question, or

4
00:00:08,746 --> 00:00:12,646
this long running discussion, on what is the difference between statistics

5
00:00:12,646 --> 00:00:16,428
and machine learning. there's, there, there's a lot of great

6
00:00:16,428 --> 00:00:19,470
papers. There's one classic paper, I, I forget the name exactly,

7
00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:22,020
but it's something along the lines of the two cultures, and

8
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:25,604
talking about why these two different approaches developed. So I think,

9
00:00:25,604 --> 00:00:28,269
if you look at machine learning, it, it grew out

10
00:00:28,269 --> 00:00:31,324
more of a computer science direction, and, and it grew

11
00:00:31,324 --> 00:00:33,534
out of a lot of areas where people had very

12
00:00:33,534 --> 00:00:37,362
practical hands on questions, right? How can we build the

13
00:00:37,362 --> 00:00:41,180
best recommendation system? How can we make the best predictions

14
00:00:41,180 --> 00:00:44,685
or classifiers for, for a given problem? And machine learning

15
00:00:44,685 --> 00:00:47,429
has developed a lot of really, really good techniques for

16
00:00:47,429 --> 00:00:50,663
doing that, for doing things that work very well in practice.

17
00:00:50,663 --> 00:00:52,823
And so I, I think that's there, there are

18
00:00:52,823 --> 00:00:55,643
a lot of applications where that's really what you're

19
00:00:55,643 --> 00:00:58,763
getting at particularly when you have the opportunity to

20
00:00:58,763 --> 00:01:01,643
build a product that will you know, take some action

21
00:01:01,643 --> 00:01:04,339
based on, based on some algorithms. Those are areas

22
00:01:04,339 --> 00:01:06,935
where machine learning is really at the cutting edge

23
00:01:06,935 --> 00:01:09,059
of coming up with the most effective ways of

24
00:01:09,059 --> 00:01:11,855
making decisions in real time based on data. I see.
