00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:03,610
Okay, why is statistics useful in data science? There's a

2
00:00:03,610 --> 00:00:08,980
lot of reasons, obviously. The, the, the first reason, I would

3
00:00:08,980 --> 00:00:11,990
say, is, the most basic one and this goes back

4
00:00:11,990 --> 00:00:15,180
to why statistics was, you know, developed a hundred or so

5
00:00:15,180 --> 00:00:17,340
years ago. And it really is to make sure that

6
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:20,650
you're making reasonable inferences from data. So you hear a lot

7
00:00:20,650 --> 00:00:23,230
of people talk about big data and the value of big

8
00:00:23,230 --> 00:00:25,520
data and how we can you know, have data on just

9
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:29,120
about everything nowadays. And it's easy to get caught

10
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:31,150
up in that and it's important to remember, that

11
00:00:31,150 --> 00:00:33,710
anytime, you're looking at any sort of data whether

12
00:00:33,710 --> 00:00:36,648
it's observational or experimental. You want to make sure that

13
00:00:36,648 --> 00:00:39,060
you're making valid inferences, right? You want to do things

14
00:00:39,060 --> 00:00:43,380
like check for statistical significance, understand confidence intervals. Make

15
00:00:43,380 --> 00:00:46,450
sure that you're not pointing you're working with in,

16
00:00:46,450 --> 00:00:51,420
in certain conc, wrong direction because you've over interpreted

17
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:53,940
some data so I think that's the first,

18
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:57,630
probably most important reasons why statistics is important to

19
00:00:57,630 --> 00:01:02,790
data science there's a lot more just working

20
00:01:02,790 --> 00:01:04,550
with data, day in and day out there's a

21
00:01:04,550 --> 00:01:08,310
lot of what I would call. Sort of,

22
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:11,960
you know very fine-grain technical skill, to just make

23
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:14,190
sure, you're doing the right thing, and you're

24
00:01:14,190 --> 00:01:16,410
extracting the most information you can out of data.
