Alright. So, why are statistical significance tests useful? So,

0:00:04.790,0:00:07.210
they do provide a formalized framework for comparing and

0:00:07.210,0:00:10.760
evaluating data. And they do enable us to evaluate

0:00:10.760,0:00:13.470
whether perceived effects in our data set reflect differences across

0:00:13.470,0:00:16.149
the whole population. They do not make a bad

0:00:16.149,0:00:19.190
result look good. Significant sets are useful because they provide

0:00:19.190,0:00:22.640
a formalized framework for comparing and evaluating data. Different

0:00:22.640,0:00:26.500
tests have different assumptions and rules that they incorporate, and

0:00:26.500,0:00:28.780
using a particular test ensures that everyone is on the

0:00:28.780,0:00:30.990
same page in so far as what we're assuming about

0:00:30.990,0:00:34.820
our data. Significance tests also enable us to evaluate whether

0:00:34.820,0:00:37.550
perceived effects in our data set reflect differences across the whole

0:00:37.550,0:00:40.796
population. As was the case with our company, where ten

0:00:40.796,0:00:45.180
out of ten people polled preferred the color blue. Sometimes an

0:00:45.180,0:00:47.770
affect that we seen in a small sample does not

0:00:47.770,0:00:51.500
reflect what might be true across the entire population. A statistical

0:00:51.500,0:00:54.420
significance test let's us formally determine whether or not this might

0:00:54.420,0:00:57.940
be the case. Unfortunately, a bad result is not going to

0:00:57.940,0:01:00.390
look any better or worse as a result of using a

0:01:00.390,0:01:02.950
statistical significance test. If our data's

0:01:02.950,0:01:05.010
bad, or there's really no difference

0:01:05.010,0:01:07.930
between our two samples. We're not going to be able to

0:01:07.930,0:01:11.470
undo that with a test. It is possible though that different tests

0:01:11.470,0:01:14.890
might give us different results. The really important thing and we'll

0:01:14.890,0:01:16.580
go into this a bit more is that you need to use

0:01:16.580,0:01:19.290
the right test in the right situations. Why don't we talk a

0:01:19.290,0:01:22.430
little bit about how we might actually run a statistical significance test.
