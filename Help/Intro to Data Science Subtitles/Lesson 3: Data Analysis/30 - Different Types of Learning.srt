There are many different types of machine learning

2
00:00:02,510 --> 00:00:06,240
problems, but two common ones are supervised learning and

3
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:10,020
unsupervised learning. Machine learning typically involves generating some

4
00:00:10,020 --> 00:00:12,220
type of model regarding the problem we're trying to

5
00:00:12,220 --> 00:00:15,440
solve. We'll feed data into this model and

6
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:19,620
then try to make predictions. In supervised learning, there

7
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:22,080
are labeled inputs that we train our model

8
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:26,010
on. Training our model simply means teaching the model

9
00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:30,000
what the answer looks like. So, for example, if we

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,100
were detecting spam using supervised learning, we might have 100 emails

11
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:36,960
where we know whether or not they're spam. We can

12
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:39,054
use these emails, where we know whether or not the email

13
00:00:39,054 --> 00:00:42,000
is spam, and train a model that can predict whether

14
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,350
or not a future email will be spam based on a

15
00:00:44,350 --> 00:00:47,340
bunch of characteristics, maybe its contents, or whether or not it

16
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:51,450
has an attachment, or things like that. Another example of supervised

17
00:00:51,450 --> 00:00:54,350
learning would be estimating the cost of a new house,

18
00:00:54,350 --> 00:00:56,500
given that we have a number of examples where we know

19
00:00:56,500 --> 00:00:59,060
about a bunch of features like the square footage, or the

20
00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:02,140
number of rooms, or the location. And we also know how

21
00:01:02,140 --> 00:01:05,410
much that house sold for. We could train a model,

22
00:01:05,410 --> 00:01:07,900
and then predict how much a future house will sell for,

23
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:11,790
given we know all the same parameters. This is an example

24
00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:16,700
of regression. When performing unsupervised learning, we don't have any such

25
00:01:16,700 --> 00:01:19,860
training examples. Instead we have a bunch of

26
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:22,430
unlabeled data points, and we're trying to understand the

27
00:01:22,430 --> 00:01:26,090
structure of the data, often by clustering similar data

28
00:01:26,090 --> 00:01:29,810
points together. For example, if we were to feed

29
00:01:29,810 --> 00:01:32,570
an unsupervised learning algorithm a bunch of photos,

30
00:01:32,570 --> 00:01:35,710
it might split the photos into groups, say photos

31
00:01:35,710 --> 00:01:39,210
of people, photos of horses, photos of buildings, without

32
00:01:39,210 --> 00:01:42,160
being told a priori what those groups should be.

33
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:44,590
It might not know that the groups are people, or horses,

34
00:01:44,590 --> 00:01:47,245
or buildings, but it can tell that these distinct groups exist.
