00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:04,019
The correct answer is that a non-parametric test does not assume the data is not

2
00:00:04,019 --> 00:00:07,770
drawn from any particular probability distribution. There's not

3
00:00:07,770 --> 00:00:10,780
really any such thing as a non-parametric probability

4
00:00:10,780 --> 00:00:14,360
distribution. This terminology non parametric really describes test

5
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:18,690
types or statistical methods. Assuming a non-Gaussian probability

6
00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:22,400
distribution would still assume some probability distribution. And

7
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:25,340
finally, Welch's t-test is definitely not a non-parametric

8
00:00:25,340 --> 00:00:30,100
test, since it assumes a certain underlying probability distribution so there's

9
00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:34,120
no way that the non-parametric test is the same as Welch's t-test.
