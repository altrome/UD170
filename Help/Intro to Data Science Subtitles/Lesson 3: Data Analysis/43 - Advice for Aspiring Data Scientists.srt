1
00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:02,840
Okay. Do I have tips or advice for data scientists?

2
00:00:02,840 --> 00:00:04,080
>> To become a data scientist.

3
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:07,220
>> Yeah, for aspiring data scientists. That's a

4
00:00:07,220 --> 00:00:11,040
great question and I think going back to the

5
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:14,380
issue of what is data science. Like I said,

6
00:00:14,380 --> 00:00:17,830
I think there's really I would, I would divide

7
00:00:17,830 --> 00:00:20,080
it into 3 somewhat different parts. And, and so

8
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:22,040
one of the first pieces of advice that I

9
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:23,320
would give to people looking to get in the

10
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:25,380
field is to think about what you really like,

11
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:26,830
what, what part of this kind of work do you

12
00:00:26,830 --> 00:00:29,700
really enjoy. I think for some people it really is

13
00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:32,290
the process of building things, of writing code, of building

14
00:00:32,290 --> 00:00:37,470
a product that let's say you know, surfaces recommendations or finds,

15
00:00:37,470 --> 00:00:40,990
you know similarities between users of a product. So you

16
00:00:40,990 --> 00:00:43,720
know, if you really like that, that sort of aspect

17
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:46,180
of building things there's a lot you can do in

18
00:00:46,180 --> 00:00:48,930
that direction particularly around improving

19
00:00:48,930 --> 00:00:51,730
your coding skills, things like that.

20
00:00:51,730 --> 00:00:54,030
If you really enjoy the analysis part, the statistical and

21
00:00:54,030 --> 00:00:57,350
mathematical side of things, there's a lot more you can

22
00:00:57,350 --> 00:00:59,700
do there in terms of coming up to speed with

23
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:03,680
new machine learning techniques, learning statistics more in depth. And then

24
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:08,030
finally, on the communications and strategies side there obviously a

25
00:01:08,030 --> 00:01:12,060
lot that you can do to improve your communication still, skills.

26
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:14,710
Understand how to abstract from the details, how to abstract

27
00:01:14,710 --> 00:01:17,510
out the high level issues that are important to a company.

28
00:01:17,510 --> 00:01:20,280
So the first piece of advice I would really give anyone looking to move into

29
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:24,940
this field, is to understand which of those 3 areas you enjoy the most or what

30
00:01:24,940 --> 00:01:28,710
the right mix is for you. And make sure you're focusing on the skills that, that

31
00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:30,670
will help you get ahead in the particular

32
00:01:30,670 --> 00:01:32,330
direction that's of the best fit for you.
