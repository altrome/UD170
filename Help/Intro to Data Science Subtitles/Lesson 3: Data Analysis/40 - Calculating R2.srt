1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:02,590
All right, let's walk through this solution. So first

2
00:00:02,590 --> 00:00:05,160
we're going to compute the denominator, so the data minus

3
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:07,000
the mean of the data squared, and then we'll take

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,100
the sum of that. Then we're going to compute the

5
00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:11,990
numerator, which means that we'll compute the predictions minus the

6
00:00:11,990 --> 00:00:15,040
data squared, and sum that up. And then we'll compute

7
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:19,250
R squared. So we'll just subtract this fraction, this guy

8
00:00:19,250 --> 00:00:22,070
over this guy, from one. Then we'll return R squared.
