Here are the equations for a few different normal distributions. Can you

2
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:06,160
determine from their probability distributions, the

3
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:10,000
mean, standard deviation, and variance? Fill

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,120
in your answers in these boxes below. So, mean would go in

5
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:17,581
these. Standard deviation would go in here, and variance in these guys.
