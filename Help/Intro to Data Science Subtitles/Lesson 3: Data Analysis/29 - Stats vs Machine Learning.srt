You might me wondering what the difference is

2
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:05,990
between statistics and machine learning. In short, the answer

3
00:00:05,990 --> 00:00:08,794
is not much. More and more, the 2

4
00:00:08,794 --> 00:00:10,914
fields are converging and they share many of the

5
00:00:10,914 --> 00:00:14,440
same methods. However there are couple of significant

6
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:18,820
philosophical differences between the 2 subjects. Generally, statistics is

7
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:21,770
focused on analysing existing data, in drawing valid

8
00:00:21,770 --> 00:00:25,720
conclusions, whereas machine learning is focused on making predictions.

9
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:29,310
What this translates to is the following: In statistics, we

10
00:00:29,310 --> 00:00:32,270
care a lot about how our data was collected, and

11
00:00:32,270 --> 00:00:36,360
drawing conclusions about that existing data using probability models. For

12
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:38,540
example, we might try to answer the question are left

13
00:00:38,540 --> 00:00:42,060
handed hitters statistically better than right handed ones? In the

14
00:00:42,060 --> 00:00:45,130
case of machine learning, we're a little bit more focused

15
00:00:45,130 --> 00:00:48,010
on making accurate predictions and less committed to using a

16
00:00:48,010 --> 00:00:50,910
probability model if there's a more accurate method that doesn't

17
00:00:50,910 --> 00:00:52,850
use them at all. As long as our

18
00:00:52,850 --> 00:00:56,770
machine learning method consistently makes accurate predictions for example,

19
00:00:56,770 --> 00:00:58,880
how many home runs will a player hit, we

20
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:01,520
aren't too worried about what assumptions the model makes.
