00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:03,000
Recall that the equation for a normal distribution is

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,800
1 over root 2 pi sigma squared, e to the

3
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:10,170
minus x minus mu quantity squared, over 2 sigma squared,

4
00:00:10,170 --> 00:00:12,570
where mu is the mean and sigma is the standard

5
00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:15,860
deviation. Sigma squared is the variance. If we know

6
00:00:15,860 --> 00:00:18,270
the form of this equation. It's not hard to look

7
00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:20,980
at all of these equations and figure out the values

8
00:00:20,980 --> 00:00:25,580
for the mean. Standard deviation and variance. They are five,

9
00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:31,090
12, and 144. Zero, five,

10
00:00:31,090 --> 00:00:37,290
and 25. Eight, one, and one. And zero, one, and one.
