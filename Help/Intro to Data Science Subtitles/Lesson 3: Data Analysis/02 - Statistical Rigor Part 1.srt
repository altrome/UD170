When performing an analysis, we can usually achieve statistical rigor by

2
00:00:03,719 --> 00:00:06,790
way of a significance test. These test to find whether or

3
00:00:06,790 --> 00:00:09,990
not a sample of data can disprove some conventional wisdom or

4
00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:14,410
assumption, with a predefined level of confidence. Let's first discuss at

5
00:00:14,410 --> 00:00:18,060
a high level why statistical rigors important. Let's say that you

6
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:20,410
worked in an office of 1000 people, and you wanted to

7
00:00:20,410 --> 00:00:23,100
find out what the most popular favorite color in your office

8
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:25,315
was. It would be a lot of work to ask all

9
00:00:25,315 --> 00:00:28,470
1,000 people. So you decide to just poll 10 people

10
00:00:28,470 --> 00:00:30,940
to get a pretty good idea of the office's favorite

11
00:00:30,940 --> 00:00:34,730
color. When you ask these 10 people, each one says

12
00:00:34,730 --> 00:00:38,330
"blue." With that statistic, you might say," Well, since these

13
00:00:38,330 --> 00:00:40,600
10 people out of 1,000 said blue is their favorite

14
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:44,650
color, blue must be everyone in the office's favorite color."

15
00:00:44,650 --> 00:00:47,270
Of course both you and I have some intuitive idea

16
00:00:47,270 --> 00:00:50,480
that this probably isn't true. We just happened to come

17
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:54,390
across ten people who all liked blue. Statistics formalizes

18
00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:57,130
this kind of logic. So we can assess the feasibility

19
00:00:57,130 --> 00:00:58,570
of a result that we get with a smaller

20
00:00:58,570 --> 00:01:01,570
sample when trying to say something about a larger population.
