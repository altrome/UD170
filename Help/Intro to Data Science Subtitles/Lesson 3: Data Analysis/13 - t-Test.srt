Now that we've familiarize ourselves with the normal distribution,

0:00:03.380,0:00:05.720
let's discuss one of the most common parametric test

0:00:05.720,0:00:07.470
that we might use to compare two sets of

0:00:07.470,0:00:10.490
data. Such as our samples of left handed and right

0:00:10.490,0:00:15.120
handed [INAUDIBLE], that would be the t-test. The t-test

0:00:15.120,0:00:18.800
like many statistical tests aims at accepting or rejecting

0:00:18.800,0:00:22.330
a null hypothesis. A null hypothesis is generally a

0:00:22.330,0:00:25.140
statement that we're trying to disprove by running our test.

0:00:26.310,0:00:28.740
For example, that two samples came from the same

0:00:28.740,0:00:32.710
population. This might mean that left-handed and right-handed batters show

0:00:32.710,0:00:35.460
no real difference in their batting average, or that

0:00:35.460,0:00:39.620
a certain sample is drawn from a particular probability distribution.

0:00:39.620,0:00:41.600
For example, if we had a sample of 20

0:00:41.600,0:00:45.010
heights and weights of Arbitrary baseball players, we might want

0:00:45.010,0:00:47.570
to test how likely it is that those 20 people

0:00:47.570,0:00:51.920
are drawn from the known MLB player population. A hypothesis

0:00:51.920,0:00:54.490
test such as the t-test is usually specified in

0:00:54.490,0:00:58.090
terms of a test statistic. The test statistic reduces

0:00:58.090,0:01:00.220
your data set to one number that helps to

0:01:00.220,0:01:04.530
accept or reject the null hypothesis. When performing a T-test,

0:01:04.530,0:01:08.270
we compute a test statistic called T. Depending on

0:01:08.270,0:01:11.070
the value of the test statistic T, we can determine

0:01:11.070,0:01:14.430
whether or not or null hypothesis is true. In

0:01:14.430,0:01:17.070
the case of the one sample T-test, our null hypothesis

0:01:17.070,0:01:20.550
would be that the population mean, mu, is equal to our

0:01:20.550,0:01:24.090
sample mean, mu not. In the T sample case, which we'll be

0:01:24.090,0:01:27.150
more concerned about for the purposes of our example, The null

0:01:27.150,0:01:31.740
hypothesis would be about our population means, m0 and m1 are equal.
