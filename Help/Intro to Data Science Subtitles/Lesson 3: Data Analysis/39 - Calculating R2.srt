00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:01,930
Let's make sure that you're comfortable with the

2
00:00:01,930 --> 00:00:04,670
coefficient of determination and computing it. Write a

3
00:00:04,670 --> 00:00:07,240
function that, given two input numpy arrays, data,

4
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:10,740
and predictions, that returns the coefficient of determination, r

5
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:13,670
squared, for the model that produced the predictions.

6
00:00:13,670 --> 00:00:17,530
Numpy has a couple of functions, numpy.mean and numpy.sum,

7
00:00:17,530 --> 00:00:19,270
that you might find useful here, but you

8
00:00:19,270 --> 00:00:21,420
don't have to use them. Your code goes here.
