00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:02,794
Just to quickly recap, what is the definition

2
00:00:02,794 --> 00:00:05,897
of a non-parametric test? A non-parametric test is

3
00:00:05,897 --> 00:00:08,381
a statistical test that assumes the data is

4
00:00:08,381 --> 00:00:12,474
drawn from a non-parametric probability distribution? Assumes the

5
00:00:12,474 --> 00:00:15,925
data is drawn from a non-Gaussian probability distribution?

6
00:00:15,925 --> 00:00:17,785
Does not assume the data is drawn from

7
00:00:17,785 --> 00:00:21,840
any particular underlying probability distribution? Or is the

8
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:25,620
same as Welch's t-test? Check the correct answer.
