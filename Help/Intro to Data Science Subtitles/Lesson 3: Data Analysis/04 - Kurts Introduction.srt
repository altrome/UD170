So my name's Kurt Smith, I'm a data scientist

0:00:02.469,0:00:05.440
on the Analytics team here at Twitter. Been here about

0:00:05.440,0:00:08.180
two and a half years right now and I

0:00:08.180,0:00:10.280
took, you know, a somewhat long and windy path to

0:00:10.280,0:00:14.210
getting here. I actually started out in college studying

0:00:14.210,0:00:17.390
chemical engineering and then ended up doing a PhD in

0:00:17.390,0:00:21.260
computational fluid dynamics and molecular modeling And spent quite a

0:00:21.260,0:00:25.870
while working in academia doing computational research I went from

0:00:25.870,0:00:28.210
there I moved to San Francisco several years back, and I

0:00:28.210,0:00:31.420
initially started working in the chemicals industry doing a lot of

0:00:31.420,0:00:35.030
molecular modeling. And from there the first big leap I would,

0:00:35.030,0:00:36.980
I may that I would say brought me more to the data

0:00:36.980,0:00:40.860
science direction was, moving to a startup in the healthcare space,

0:00:40.860,0:00:44.170
that was doing a lot of data analysis on a risk modeling

0:00:44.170,0:00:48.570
around chronic disease. And that really was the opportunity, or gave

0:00:48.570,0:00:51.660
me the opportunity to take a lot of my mathematical background, and

0:00:51.660,0:00:54.810
apply it to data driven problems. After working in

0:00:54.810,0:00:56.340
that area for a few years, I started to look

0:00:56.340,0:01:00.440
around in other fields with interesting data challenges. And

0:01:00.440,0:01:02.640
that brought me to moving to social media and Twitter.
