00:00:01,300 --> 00:00:05,652
We can just plug the information provided into our equations for t and new. If

2
00:00:05,652 --> 00:00:10,836
we look at the equations for t, t is 0.307 minus 0.299

3
00:00:10,836 --> 00:00:15,924
over the square root of 0.05 over 150 plus 0.08 over

4
00:00:15,924 --> 00:00:21,470
165. Which is going to be 0.280. Meanwhile new is going to be

5
00:00:21,470 --> 00:00:26,720
the quantity 0.05 over 150 plus 0.08 over 165 squared. Over 0.05

6
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:29,715
squared over 150 squared times 149 plus

7
00:00:29,715 --> 00:00:34,210
0.08 squared over 165 squared times 164, which

8
00:00:34,210 --> 00:00:40,310
is going to be 307.199. The t statistic here, again is sort of some idea of,

9
00:00:40,310 --> 00:00:45,800
you know, how extreme is our result and how likely is it to disprove our

10
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:48,720
null hypothesis? Meanwhile, the nu here is

11
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:52,810
kind of some idea of how many independent variables

12
00:00:52,810 --> 00:00:55,907
went in to calculating this t-value?
