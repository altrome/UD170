1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:02,469
So what, what are the most important dos and don'ts

2
00:00:02,469 --> 00:00:05,900
to keep in mind in data science? I think I

3
00:00:05,900 --> 00:00:09,530
would mention two. One is a bit more, qualitative and

4
00:00:09,530 --> 00:00:12,750
one is a, a bit more, quantitative. So, on the

5
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:15,250
qualitative side I, I would say the first thing is

6
00:00:15,250 --> 00:00:19,420
any problem you're looking at, it's always very valuable, I

7
00:00:19,420 --> 00:00:22,950
find, to start by thinking about. What sort of things

8
00:00:22,950 --> 00:00:25,780
do we know? What sort of expectations do we have?

9
00:00:25,780 --> 00:00:28,300
And what sort of qualitative things can we get from,

10
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:31,310
an exploratory analysis of the data? So, as I mentioned,

11
00:00:31,310 --> 00:00:34,580
using things like [INAUDIBLE] clustering and P.C.A are a good

12
00:00:34,580 --> 00:00:37,660
way to start to do some sort of dimentionality reduction.

13
00:00:37,660 --> 00:00:39,930
Some way of getting the data down to a point

14
00:00:39,930 --> 00:00:42,880
where you can. Look and get some qualitative insights. Understand

15
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:46,610
the general structure of it. And quite often in, in

16
00:00:46,610 --> 00:00:50,680
certain topics that we work on, you have some intuition of,

17
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:51,970
of what you'd expect things to look like.

18
00:00:51,970 --> 00:00:54,410
You can start to see patterns, emerging data that,

19
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:58,780
you know, that makes sense. That, that. Either confirm

20
00:00:58,780 --> 00:01:02,710
or, or possibly go against other theories or ingrained

21
00:01:02,710 --> 00:01:05,540
beliefs that people have. so, so I think getting

22
00:01:05,540 --> 00:01:07,730
data down to that point is very important. The

23
00:01:07,730 --> 00:01:12,410
more quantitative suggestion I would have, has to do

24
00:01:12,410 --> 00:01:15,710
with trying to understand causal connections. So, this is

25
00:01:15,710 --> 00:01:18,460
a very common thing that comes up. In building predictive models you

26
00:01:18,460 --> 00:01:21,460
may have a number of features. That you put into a model to

27
00:01:21,460 --> 00:01:25,210
predict some outcome. And it's very, very important when doing that. So, often

28
00:01:25,210 --> 00:01:27,980
the question comes out not just being able to predict an outcome. But

29
00:01:27,980 --> 00:01:32,520
understanding which features are actually causing it. It's important to use a

30
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:35,600
lot of caution around that. To never just sort of, dump a bunch

31
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:38,630
of data into a model with lots of features, and then just naively

32
00:01:38,630 --> 00:01:40,870
look at the thins that have the strongest weights in your model and

33
00:01:40,870 --> 00:01:43,930
say, oh. Here's what's driving it. So, it's very important when you're

34
00:01:43,930 --> 00:01:46,140
asking those kinds of causal questions

35
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:48,430
to proceed very carefully and, and rigorously.
