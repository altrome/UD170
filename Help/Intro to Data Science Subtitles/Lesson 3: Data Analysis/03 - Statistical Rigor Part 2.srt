You can also imagine a case where at first glance,

2
00:00:02,900 --> 00:00:05,830
our results might suggest that there's no significant difference but it

3
00:00:05,830 --> 00:00:08,900
turns out that there is. For example, say a website was

4
00:00:08,900 --> 00:00:11,620
running an AB test between two different versions of our landing

5
00:00:11,620 --> 00:00:14,670
page. They're trying to see which version of the page converts

6
00:00:14,670 --> 00:00:18,330
more visits to clicks. Say they run a test for weeks

7
00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:22,700
and weeks, placing 500,000 visitors into each test group. One strategy

8
00:00:22,700 --> 00:00:25,600
had a conversion rate of 50%, another had a conversion rate

9
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:30,675
of 50.5%. If we run a significance test on this data, we can say with a

10
00:00:30,675 --> 00:00:33,090
95% confidence level that there is a statistically

11
00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:36,510
significant, albeit small difference between the two strategies.
