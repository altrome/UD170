00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:02,540
There are two parameters associated with a normal

2
00:00:02,540 --> 00:00:07,730
distribution. The mean, mu, and the standard deviation, sigma.

3
00:00:07,730 --> 00:00:10,523
These two parameters plug in to the following probability

4
00:00:10,523 --> 00:00:14,160
density function, which describes a Gaussian distribution. The expected

5
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:15,670
value of a variable described by a Gaussian

6
00:00:15,670 --> 00:00:19,110
distribution is the mean, mu, and the variance is

7
00:00:19,110 --> 00:00:22,690
the standard deviation, sigma squared. Normal distributions are also

8
00:00:22,690 --> 00:00:25,600
symmetric about their mean. If you've taken an introduction

9
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:28,440
to stats course, the normal distribution should be a familiar tool.
