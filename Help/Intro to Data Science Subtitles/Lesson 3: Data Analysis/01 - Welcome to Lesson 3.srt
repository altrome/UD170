00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:02,650
Welcome to the third lesson in Introduction to Data

2
00:00:02,650 --> 00:00:05,590
Science. During this lesson, we're going to be focusing on

3
00:00:05,590 --> 00:00:08,480
some basic methods in statistics and machine learning that you

4
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:11,700
can use to analyze data. During the last lesson, we

5
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:14,860
mainly focused on methods to acquire and clean data from

6
00:00:14,860 --> 00:00:18,550
a variety of sources, such as relational databases, APIs, and

7
00:00:18,550 --> 00:00:22,810
flat files. However we also discuss some basic methods that

8
00:00:22,810 --> 00:00:25,930
you can use to verify the integrity of your data.

9
00:00:25,930 --> 00:00:27,950
And while you're doing that you might learn some very

10
00:00:27,950 --> 00:00:31,165
basic things. For example, you might know who the tallest

11
00:00:31,165 --> 00:00:34,230
shortstop to ever play in major league baseball was, or,

12
00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:37,304
how many people over the age of 65 enrolled in the

13
00:00:37,304 --> 00:00:41,536
[INAUDIBLE] program in a particular district. You might find, though,

14
00:00:41,536 --> 00:00:44,579
that you want to answer some more subtle questions. For example,

15
00:00:44,579 --> 00:00:47,015
we might want to know, are left handed batters any

16
00:00:47,015 --> 00:00:51,298
better than right handed batters? Or, hey, is there any correlation

17
00:00:51,298 --> 00:00:55,045
between age and the [UNKNOWN] rejection rate? We'll use

18
00:00:55,045 --> 00:00:58,611
statistics and machine learning to answer these types of questions.

19
00:00:58,611 --> 00:01:00,963
We'll also find that these methods are really useful for

20
00:01:00,963 --> 00:01:04,300
answering questions about ridership on the New York City subway.

21
00:01:04,300 --> 00:01:06,200
For example, we might be able to discover whether

22
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:09,140
time of day, or the weather outside, influence how many

23
00:01:09,140 --> 00:01:13,350
people are riding the subway. During this lesson, we're going

24
00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:16,455
to assume some basic familiarity with stats. Either you haven't

25
00:01:16,455 --> 00:01:19,591
seen the stuff or if you feel lost, it might be a good idea to

26
00:01:19,591 --> 00:01:22,301
enroll in Stats 95. I've included a link

27
00:01:22,301 --> 00:01:25,870
in the instructor comments. Alright, let's jump in.
