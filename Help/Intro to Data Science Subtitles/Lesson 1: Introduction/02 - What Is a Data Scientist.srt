People have many different conceptions of what data

2
00:00:02,490 --> 00:00:06,470
scientists do. Some might say that a data scientist

3
00:00:06,470 --> 00:00:08,320
is just a data analyst who lives in

4
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:12,270
California. While others might say that a data scientist

5
00:00:12,270 --> 00:00:14,470
is a person who's better at statistics than

6
00:00:14,470 --> 00:00:17,430
any software engineer, and better at software engineering than

7
00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:22,250
any statistician. As you can see, definitions vary wildly

8
00:00:22,250 --> 00:00:24,570
from place to place, and from person to person.
