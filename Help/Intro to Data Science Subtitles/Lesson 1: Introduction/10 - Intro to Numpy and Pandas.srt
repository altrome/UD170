As you can imagine, since data science is being deployed in a wide range of

0:00:04.540,0:00:08.500
fields, data scientists use many different tools, depending on the task at hand.

0:00:09.660,0:00:13.480
Two of the most common tools used by data scientists are Numpy and Pandas.

0:00:14.870,0:00:16.780
Numpy is popular because it adds support for

0:00:16.780,0:00:19.930
things like multi-dimensional arrays and matrices.

0:00:19.930,0:00:23.870
It also adds a lot of mathematical functions that base python lacks.

0:00:23.870,0:00:26.130
Pandas on the other hand, allows us to structure and

0:00:26.130,0:00:29.850
manipulate our data in ways that are particularly well suited for data analysis.

If you happen to be familiar with the scripting language R,

0:00:34.110,0:00:37.610
Pandas takes a lot of the best elements from R and implements them in Python.

0:00:38.800,0:00:42.770
Both Numpy and Pandas are popular tools in the data science world, so

0:00:42.770,0:00:46.290
being familiar with them will help you read other people's code in the future.

0:00:46.290,0:00:49.042
Why don't we quickly discuss a couple of the more important features in both

0:00:49.042,0:00:49.733
Numpy and Pandas?
