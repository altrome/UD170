00:00:00,070 --> 00:00:02,840
The term data science is actually pretty new to me

2
00:00:02,840 --> 00:00:05,100
as well, even though now I think about it, I have

3
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:08,100
been doing data science since the day I was at

4
00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:11,870
in Taiwan doing a Masters in, in speech recognition. The way

5
00:00:11,870 --> 00:00:13,960
we would understand speech is to collect a lot of

6
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:16,830
data and understand how to model things like a phoneme in

7
00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:21,930
speech. And how to understand you know, people's language processing

8
00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:24,910
requires a lot of data collection as well. And at Google,

9
00:00:24,910 --> 00:00:28,840
which is a company that collects a lot of data, I also did personalization

10
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:30,480
there which requires a lot of data

11
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:33,220
going in, you know, understanding a person's behavior.

12
00:00:33,220 --> 00:00:38,400
So, that to me is data science. Using data to build a useful model or

13
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:40,360
to understand a particular pattern that is

14
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:42,870
useful, then later on, for other software applications.
