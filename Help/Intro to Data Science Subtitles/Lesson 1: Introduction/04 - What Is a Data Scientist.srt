00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:04,430
Let me tell you my perspective. From personal experience,

2
00:00:04,430 --> 00:00:06,700
data scientists today are people who have a blend

3
00:00:06,700 --> 00:00:10,450
of many different skills. This Venn diagram shows a

4
00:00:10,450 --> 00:00:12,720
definition of a data scientist that I like a lot.

5
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:15,740
A data scientist is someone who knows mathematics and

6
00:00:15,740 --> 00:00:19,510
statistics, which allows them to identify interesting insights in

7
00:00:19,510 --> 00:00:22,550
a sea of data. They also have the programming

8
00:00:22,550 --> 00:00:25,420
skills to code up statistical models and get data from

9
00:00:25,420 --> 00:00:28,750
a variety of different data sources. Furthermore, a data

10
00:00:28,750 --> 00:00:30,860
scientist is someone who knows how to ask the right

11
00:00:30,860 --> 00:00:34,670
questions and translate those questions into a sound analysis.

12
00:00:34,670 --> 00:00:37,740
After doing the analysis, they have the communication skills to

13
00:00:37,740 --> 00:00:40,010
report their findings in a way that people can

14
00:00:40,010 --> 00:00:43,990
easily understand. In other words, data scientists have the ability

15
00:00:43,990 --> 00:00:48,290
to perform complicated analysis on huge data sets. Once they've

16
00:00:48,290 --> 00:00:50,940
done this, they also have the ability to write and

17
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:53,790
make informative graphs to communicate their findings to others.
