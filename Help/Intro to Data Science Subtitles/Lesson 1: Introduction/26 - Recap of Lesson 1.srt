To recap today's lesson, data science is a discipline

0:00:03.290,0:00:06.390
that incorporates methods and expertise from a variety of different

0:00:06.390,0:00:10.160
fields, to glean insights from large data sets, and then

0:00:10.160,0:00:13.170
use those insights to build data driven products, or to

0:00:13.170,0:00:16.590
create action items. There's no cookie cutter way to become

0:00:16.590,0:00:19.220
a data scientist, but a lot of data scientists have

0:00:19.220,0:00:23.010
a very strong background in mathematics and statistics, and also

0:00:23.010,0:00:25.580
have the programming skills to handle these data sets and

0:00:25.580,0:00:29.980
also to perform analysis. Currently, data science is most closely

0:00:29.980,0:00:32.560
associated with the tech field, but more and more data

0:00:32.560,0:00:34.660
science is being used all over the world in a

0:00:34.660,0:00:37.570
variety of different fields. In order to solve new and

0:00:37.570,0:00:41.920
old problems, more efficiently and effectively. Now I know what

0:00:41.920,0:00:45.190
you're thinking. This sounds awesome, data science sounds really cool,

0:00:45.190,0:00:46.680
I want to work on a project get me some

0:00:46.680,0:00:51.470
data. Unfortunately, data seldom comes in formats that we want.

0:00:51.470,0:00:54.150
It might be in a format we've never seen, it might come from a

0:00:54.150,0:00:56.220
weird source. There might be missing or

0:00:56.220,0:00:59.520
erroneous values. Because of this, any data

0:00:59.520,0:01:01.350
scientist worth their salt is skilled at

0:01:01.350,0:01:03.750
acquiring data. And then massaging it into

0:01:03.750,0:01:07.340
a workable format. That's what we're going to be covering in the next lesson.
