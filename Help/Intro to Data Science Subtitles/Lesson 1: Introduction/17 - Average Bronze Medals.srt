Why don't you try doing some basic analysis on our Sochi Olympic

0:00:04.410,0:00:05.010
medal count data?

0:00:06.200,0:00:10.260
Using the data frame you created in the previous exercise, compute the average

0:00:10.260,0:00:14.220
number of bronze medals earned by countries who earned at least one gold medal.

0:00:15.250,0:00:20.080
Save this to a variable named avg_bronze_at_least_one_gold.

0:00:20.080,0:00:21.120
Your code should go here
