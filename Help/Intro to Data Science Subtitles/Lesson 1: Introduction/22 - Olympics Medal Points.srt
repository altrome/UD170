Why don't you try your hand at using the numpy.dot function?

0:00:04.450,0:00:07.890
Imagine a scoring system in which each country is awarded four points for

0:00:07.890,0:00:11.700
each gold medal, two points for each silver medal, and one point for

0:00:11.700,0:00:12.438
each bronze medal.

0:00:12.438,0:00:17.970
Using the numpy.dot function, create a new dataframe called olympic_points_df

0:00:17.970,0:00:22.150
that includes a column called country_name with the country name and points with

0:00:22.150,0:00:26.030
the total number of points that that country earned at the Sochi olympics.

0:00:26.030,0:00:27.030
Your code should go here.
