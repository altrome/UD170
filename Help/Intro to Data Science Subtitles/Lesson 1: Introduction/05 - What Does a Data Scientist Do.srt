Here are some things that a data scientist may do

2
00:00:02,390 --> 00:00:06,320
in his or her daily work. They might wrangle data. That

3
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:09,480
is, collect data from the real world, process it, and

4
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:12,010
create a data set that can be analyzed. Once they have

5
00:00:12,010 --> 00:00:14,650
a data set, they may analyze trends in the existing

6
00:00:14,650 --> 00:00:17,960
data or try to make data driven predictions about the future

7
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:21,610
using the data at hand. Based on this models or predictions,

8
00:00:21,610 --> 00:00:25,190
they cannot only build data driven products but also communicate their

9
00:00:25,190 --> 00:00:27,950
findings to those other data scientists and the general

10
00:00:27,950 --> 00:00:32,720
public. File visualizations, reports or blog posts. But hey,

11
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:34,720
this is my point of view. Why don't we

12
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:37,370
talk to some other data scientists and hear their thoughts.
