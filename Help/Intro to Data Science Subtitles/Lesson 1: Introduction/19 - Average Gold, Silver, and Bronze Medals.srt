Why don't you try operating on our Sochi medal count data in a vectorized way?

0:00:04.950,0:00:09.480
Using pandas, numpy, and the dataframe's apply method, create a new dataframe

0:00:09.480,0:00:13.740
called avg_medal_count that indicates the average number of gold, silver and

0:00:13.740,0:00:16.530
bronze medals that were earned amongst countries who earned at

0:00:16.530,0:00:20.480
least one medal at the 2014 Sochi olympics.
