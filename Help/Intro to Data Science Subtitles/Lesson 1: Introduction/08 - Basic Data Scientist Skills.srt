00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:02,700
As we discussed earlier in this lesson, a data

2
00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:07,640
scientist needs to have substantive expertise. What does that mean?

3
00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:10,180
Well typically it means that a data scientist knows

4
00:00:10,180 --> 00:00:14,300
which questions to ask, can interpret the data well and

5
00:00:14,300 --> 00:00:16,980
understands the structure of the data. You can imagine

6
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:19,070
that a data scientist needs to know about the problem

7
00:00:19,070 --> 00:00:21,665
that solving. For example, if you are solving an

8
00:00:21,665 --> 00:00:25,200
on-line advertising problem, you want to make sure you understand what

9
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:27,450
types of people are coming to your website. How they are

10
00:00:27,450 --> 00:00:31,790
interacting with the website and what different data means that can

11
00:00:31,790 --> 00:00:35,410
help you ask the right questions like, Are people falling off

12
00:00:35,410 --> 00:00:38,090
and not completing our ads at a certain point in the

13
00:00:38,090 --> 00:00:41,340
flow, or do people complete more ads at a certain time

14
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:44,250
of the day? You would also, then, be very familiar with

15
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:46,820
how the data is stored and structured. And that could help

16
00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:50,540
you work more efficiently and more effectively. This is why it's important

17
00:00:50,540 --> 00:00:53,850
for a data scientist to have substantive expertise. It's

18
00:00:53,850 --> 00:00:55,980
important to note that data scientists usually work in

19
00:00:55,980 --> 00:00:58,410
teams. So it's normal for data scientists to be

20
00:00:58,410 --> 00:01:02,090
stronger in some areas and weaker in others. So even

21
00:01:02,090 --> 00:01:03,740
if you, as a data scientist, don't have a

22
00:01:03,740 --> 00:01:07,220
tons of substantive expertise, if you have great hacking

23
00:01:07,220 --> 00:01:09,670
skills or know a lot of statistics you can

24
00:01:09,670 --> 00:01:11,860
still be a valuable member of a data science team.
