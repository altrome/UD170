1
00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:02,420
Now that you have a better Idea of what data

2
00:00:02,420 --> 00:00:06,100
science is, and what data scientist do, let's talk about

3
00:00:06,100 --> 00:00:08,940
how data science can be applied across a wide spectrum

4
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:12,840
of industries. You might have signed up for this class under

5
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:15,740
the notion that if you become a data scientist, you'll

6
00:00:15,740 --> 00:00:19,460
end up working for a Silicon Valley startup. Well it's true

7
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:22,970
that most tech companies do employ data scientists. Data science

8
00:00:22,970 --> 00:00:25,340
can also be used to solve problems in many different fields.

9
00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:28,170
What are some examples of the types of

10
00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:32,130
problems being solved using data science? Well for one,

11
00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:35,390
Netflix uses collaborative filtering algorithms to recommend movies

12
00:00:35,390 --> 00:00:39,020
to users based on things they've previously watched. Also,

13
00:00:39,020 --> 00:00:41,510
elements of many popular social media websites are

14
00:00:41,510 --> 00:00:45,200
powered by data science. Things like recommending new connections

15
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:48,540
on Linkedin, constructing your Facebook news feed or

16
00:00:48,540 --> 00:00:51,650
suggesting new people to follow on Twitter. Many other

17
00:00:51,650 --> 00:00:54,580
online services or apps such as dating websites like

18
00:00:54,580 --> 00:00:57,910
OKCupid or right sharing services like Uber using the

19
00:00:57,910 --> 00:01:00,190
vast amount of user data available to them, not

20
00:01:00,190 --> 00:01:03,700
only need to customize and improve the user experience but

21
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:07,490
also to publish interesting anthropological findings regarding people's behavior

22
00:01:07,490 --> 00:01:10,990
in the offline world on their blogs. Okay, so

23
00:01:10,990 --> 00:01:13,170
I know what you're thinking. So far, all of

24
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:16,800
these seem like problems data scientists are expected to solve,

25
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:19,890
but data scientists work in many domains. Data

26
00:01:19,890 --> 00:01:23,030
science concepts are integral in processing and modeling data

27
00:01:23,030 --> 00:01:25,960
in the field bioinformatics where scientists are working on

28
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:30,240
projects like annotating genomes and analyzing data sequences. This

29
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:32,680
past summer, data science for social good fellows

30
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:34,810
in Chicago worked on a project attempting to solve

31
00:01:34,810 --> 00:01:39,120
Chicago's bus crowding issues using data. In addition, physicists

32
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:41,940
use data science concepts when building a 100 terabyte

33
00:01:41,940 --> 00:01:44,550
database of astronomical data collected by the Sloan

34
00:01:44,550 --> 00:01:48,790
digital sky server. This one's cool. Analyzing electronic

35
00:01:48,790 --> 00:01:50,790
medical records allowed the city of Camden, New

36
00:01:50,790 --> 00:01:54,130
Jersey to save enormous amounts of money by targeting

37
00:01:54,130 --> 00:01:56,750
their efforts towards specific buildings accounting for a

38
00:01:56,750 --> 00:02:01,290
majority of emergency admission. Finally, NBA teams like the

39
00:02:01,290 --> 00:02:04,610
Toronto Raptors are installing a new technology, sports

40
00:02:04,610 --> 00:02:07,250
view cameras, on the basketball courts. They collect huge

41
00:02:07,250 --> 00:02:10,600
amounts of data on players movement and playing styles.

42
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:13,430
This helps teams to better analyze game trends and improve

43
00:02:13,430 --> 00:02:17,180
coaching decisions. You've probably noticed by now that data science

44
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:20,430
is making an impact in areas far and wide. Data

45
00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:22,780
science isn't simply a trendy new way to think about

46
00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:25,400
tech problems. It's a tool that can be used to

47
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:28,950
solve problems in a variety of fields. Data scientists are

48
00:02:28,950 --> 00:02:32,570
working at Silicon Valley start-ups to enrich our online experiences,

49
00:02:32,570 --> 00:02:34,430
but they're also doing important work in our

50
00:02:34,430 --> 00:02:37,760
cities, in our laboratories and in our sports stadiums.
