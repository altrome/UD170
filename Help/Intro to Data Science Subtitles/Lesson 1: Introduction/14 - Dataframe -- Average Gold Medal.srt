0:00:00.830,0:00:02.960
All right, why don't we walk through the solution.

0:00:02.960,0:00:06.700
First we define these Python lists called countries, gold, silver, and

0:00:06.700,0:00:11.850
bronze, which give us ordered lists of the country names, gold medal counts,

0:00:11.850,0:00:13.040
silver medal counts, and

0:00:13.040,0:00:18.420
bronze medal counts as they appear in the Sochi medal count table.

0:00:18.420,0:00:21.550
Then we create this Python dictionary, Olympic medal counts.

0:00:21.550,0:00:23.630
Where the keys are our column names and

0:00:23.630,0:00:27.770
the values are panda series containing these lists.

0:00:27.770,0:00:31.271
Finally, we create our data frame Olympic_medal_counts_df by

0:00:31.271,0:00:34.240
passing olympic_medal_counts into the DataFrame function.
