Now that we know a little bit about manipulating data,

0:00:03.310,0:00:06.480
why don't we talk about how we'll store and reference it using Pandas.

0:00:07.490,0:00:11.510
Data in Pandas is often contained in a structure called a data frame.

0:00:11.510,0:00:15.730
A data frame is a two dimensional labeled data structure with columns which can

0:00:15.730,0:00:17.700
be different types if necessary.

0:00:17.700,0:00:25.121
For example, types like string, int, float, or Boolean.

0:00:26.240,0:00:29.690
You can think of a data frame as being similar to an Excel spreadsheet.

0:00:29.690,0:00:32.360
We'll talk about making data frames in a second.

0:00:32.360,0:00:35.410
For now, here's what an example data frame might look like,

0:00:35.410,0:00:38.790
using data describing passengers on the Titanic and whether or

0:00:38.790,0:00:41.430
not they survived the Titanic's tragic collision with an iceberg.

0:00:42.510,0:00:45.220
You'll be using this very data set for project number one.

0:00:45.220,0:00:47.580
Note that there are numerous different columns.

0:00:47.580,0:00:51.290
Name, age, fare, and survived.

0:00:51.290,0:00:54.050
And that these columns all have different data types.

0:00:54.050,0:00:55.030
Age is all integers.

0:00:55.030,0:00:56.830
Survived is all Boolean, et cetera.

0:00:58.170,0:01:00.530
There are also some not a number entries.

0:01:00.530,0:01:03.470
This is what happens when we don't specify a value.

0:01:03.470,0:01:05.630
How would we go about making this data frame.

0:01:05.630,0:01:09.900
First, I'll create a Python dictionary called d where each key is the name of

0:01:09.900,0:01:14.140
one of my columns and the corresponding value is a Python series where I

0:01:14.140,0:01:17.900
first pass in an array with the values for the actual data frame and

0:01:17.900,0:01:20.260
then an array of indexes where I want those values to go.

0:01:22.410,0:01:26.570
And notice that in the case of fare where there is a not a number value, I only

0:01:26.570,0:01:31.360
provide three actual values, but then I provide the three corresponding indices.

0:01:31.360,0:01:34.110
Once I've created this dictionary, I can pass it as an argument to

0:01:34.110,0:01:37.120
the DataFrame function to create my actual data frame.

0:01:37.120,0:01:38.240
Here I'll call that data frame df.

0:01:38.240,0:01:42.180
You'll see that the data frame we've printed here matches the one that we had on

0:01:42.180,0:01:43.510
the tablet earlier in this lesson.
