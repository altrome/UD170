1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:02,780
Through the class project, you'll investigate New York

2
00:00:02,780 --> 00:00:06,870
City subway ridership as a data scientist might. First,

3
00:00:06,870 --> 00:00:09,850
you'll pull some publicly available data on subway ridership,

4
00:00:09,850 --> 00:00:12,440
and also on New York weather conditions, using the

5
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:14,970
New York MTA website and the Weather Underground

6
00:00:14,970 --> 00:00:19,110
API. Then, you'll answer some questions about subway ridership

7
00:00:19,110 --> 00:00:22,810
using statistics and machine learning. Does the weather influence

8
00:00:22,810 --> 00:00:25,650
how many people ride the subway? Is the subway

9
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:28,280
busier at certain times than others? Can we

10
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:31,950
predict subway ridership? Finally, you'll develop some charts

11
00:00:31,950 --> 00:00:34,930
and graphics that communicate your findings, and synthesize

12
00:00:34,930 --> 00:00:37,140
everything into a cohesive write-up that your friends

13
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:40,010
or family might find useful and informative. This

14
00:00:40,010 --> 00:00:41,820
may sound daunting, but we'll be going through

15
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:45,810
this step by step, and learning how to use the necessary tools as we go along.
