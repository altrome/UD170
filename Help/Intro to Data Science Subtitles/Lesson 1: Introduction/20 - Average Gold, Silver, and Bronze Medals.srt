0:00:00.560,0:00:02.760
All right, why don't we walk through the solution?

0:00:02.760,0:00:05.880
Here we define our olympic_medal_counts_df data frame as we have in

0:00:05.880,0:00:07.150
the past couple of exercises.

0:00:08.330,0:00:13.160
Then we simply say avg_medal_count is equal to olympic_medal_counts_df and

0:00:13.160,0:00:16.880
we pick out only the gold, silver and bronze columns and

0:00:16.880,0:00:23.239
then we use the data frames apply method and provide us the argument numpy.mean
