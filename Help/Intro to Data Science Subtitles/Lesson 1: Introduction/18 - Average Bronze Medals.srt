0:00:00.980,0:00:02.605
All right, why don't we walk through the solution?

0:00:02.605,0:00:07.190
Here we've created the olympic_medal_counts_df data frame as we

0:00:07.190,0:00:08.420
did in the previous exercise.

0:00:09.790,0:00:13.084
Now we're going to define this variable called bronze_at_least_one_gold.

0:00:14.280,0:00:16.920
What we're doing here is we're picking out the bronze column of

0:00:16.920,0:00:18.941
the olympics_medal_counts_df data frame.

0:00:20.240,0:00:23.170
Then we're picking out only the subset of that column.

0:00:23.170,0:00:27.370
With the indices matching the indices where olympic_metal_counts_df's gold

0:00:27.370,0:00:30.830
column is greater than or equal to one.

0:00:30.830,0:00:35.600
Then, we're using numpy.mean to take the average of

0:00:35.600,0:00:41.774
those values in assigning them to this variable, avg_bronze_at_least_one_gold.
