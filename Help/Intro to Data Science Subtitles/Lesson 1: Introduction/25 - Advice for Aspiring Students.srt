1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:03,140
So for me, the reason why I even come into

2
00:00:03,140 --> 00:00:06,980
this field of data science is my passion for something specific,

3
00:00:06,980 --> 00:00:10,630
which is natural language. Right, so I, and it, I

4
00:00:10,630 --> 00:00:13,110
observe the people who work around me who knows about data

5
00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:16,379
science. I think one thing that's very important is they

6
00:00:16,379 --> 00:00:19,430
either have, like, a passion for the particular data they're looking

7
00:00:19,430 --> 00:00:22,240
at. Like, you know, natural language, or like speech recognition kind

8
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:25,290
of data. Or some people are just very interested in patterns

9
00:00:25,290 --> 00:00:29,270
in data. Like when they see some kind of some, data they

10
00:00:29,270 --> 00:00:31,870
would just like, try to calculate you know, like the mean of

11
00:00:31,870 --> 00:00:34,360
the data, the variance of data. They, they, it comes natural to

12
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:36,810
them because they want to find patterns to the data. So I think

13
00:00:36,810 --> 00:00:39,520
for anyone who wants to become a data scientist, it's good to

14
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:43,370
think about, what kind of data you are interested in doing, and

15
00:00:43,370 --> 00:00:46,100
start with that. And then later on when you have this skill

16
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:49,500
of analyzing data, you can apply it to any other kind of thing.
