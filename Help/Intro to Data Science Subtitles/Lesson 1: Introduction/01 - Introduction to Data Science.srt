Hi, and welcome to Introduction to Data Science. My name's

0:00:04.380,0:00:07.590
Dave, and I'll be the instructor for this course. I've

0:00:07.590,0:00:10.200
worked as a data scientist in Silicon Valley, most recently

0:00:10.200,0:00:12.590
at a small company called Yub and before that at

0:00:12.590,0:00:16.530
a company called TrialPay. I'm formally trained as a physicist,

0:00:16.530,0:00:18.970
and I originally became interested in data scientist because I

0:00:18.970,0:00:22.100
love the idea of improving the quality of people's lives

0:00:22.100,0:00:26.560
or. Building really cool products by using data and mathematics.

0:00:26.560,0:00:29.480
In this lesson, we'll discuss data science at a high level.

0:00:29.480,0:00:32.750
Together we'll find out what data science is and discuss what skills

0:00:32.750,0:00:36.260
are required to be a data scientist. We'll also hear from a

0:00:36.260,0:00:40.000
bunch of other data scientists about interesting projects they worked on. And

0:00:40.000,0:00:42.180
discuss how data science is being used to solve a bunch

0:00:42.180,0:00:45.440
of different problems. This lesson in particular is going to be a

0:00:45.440,0:00:47.910
little bit different than the others. We're not going to build as

0:00:47.910,0:00:51.680
much. I think it's important to understand data science at high level

0:00:51.680,0:00:54.940
before we dive into the details. Alright, well I'm really

0:00:54.940,0:00:56.970
excited about this course, so why don't we get started.
