1
00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:03,500
All right, the most accurate visual encoding of

2
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:08,070
these four is position. After that is angle. Area

3
00:00:08,070 --> 00:00:11,040
is the next most accurate. And finally, saturation

4
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:13,800
is the least accurate of these four visual encodings.
