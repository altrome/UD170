My tips for aspiring data scientists would be to sort of learn the tools

2
00:00:06,939 --> 00:00:12,920
for data science very well, very, very well. And of course through several

3
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:20,340
curriculum, for example, Udacity from university courses, etc. Moreover, to use

4
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:25,380
them in the correct way. You know, one of the analogies I like using is Galileo,

5
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:30,180
before Galileo, the telescope existed, but he used it to look

6
00:00:30,180 --> 00:00:34,150
at the stars and it changed the course of history. So it's

7
00:00:34,150 --> 00:00:37,230
important to know your tools, how to use them, and use them

8
00:00:37,230 --> 00:00:41,360
to do something innovative and new and different. And that's my advice.
