00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:03,280
My name is Rishiraj Pravahan and I'm a

2
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:06,140
principal data scientist at the AT&T big data

3
00:00:06,140 --> 00:00:09,480
center in Palo Alto. My background actually is

4
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:14,300
in high energy experimental high energy physics and

5
00:00:14,300 --> 00:00:19,600
I was, before here, I was at CERN for about 7 years. That's where I did my

6
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:25,780
PhD and post-doc for a few years. So that's sort of where I came from.

7
00:00:25,780 --> 00:00:31,010
And I became a data scientist almost as a natural sort of step towards

8
00:00:31,010 --> 00:00:36,360
learning about data and dealing with big data, as you know, [UNKNOWN] produce a

9
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:40,330
large amount of data. And we have to handle it and analyze it so

10
00:00:41,570 --> 00:00:44,890
along the way I picked up the skills to become a data scientist, and so.
