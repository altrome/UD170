00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:03,010
Generally speaking, there are four important ingredients

2
00:00:03,010 --> 00:00:07,444
to any information visualization. Visual cues, coordinate

3
00:00:07,444 --> 00:00:12,110
systems, scale and data types, and context.

4
00:00:12,110 --> 00:00:13,970
Let's use this line chart, which shows total

5
00:00:13,970 --> 00:00:15,490
home runs by year in major league

6
00:00:15,490 --> 00:00:18,660
baseball to showcase each of these ingredients.

7
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:21,210
So, the first ingredient was visual cues,

8
00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:24,560
or visual encoding. This is encoding data with

9
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:28,200
shapes, colors, and sizes. For example, if we look at this

10
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:30,480
chart, we can show that each point shows the number of home

11
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:33,450
runs in a given year. And we can also see that

12
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:35,780
the lines connecting the points give us some sense of the rate

13
00:00:35,780 --> 00:00:37,960
of change of number of home runs hit from year to

14
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:42,150
year. There were also coordinate systems. So we need to place our

15
00:00:42,150 --> 00:00:45,950
data point somewhere on the chart. A coordinate system gives us

16
00:00:45,950 --> 00:00:49,980
a structured space that dictates where the shapes and color should go.

17
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:52,280
This gives meaning to and x, y coordinate on

18
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:56,550
this chart. For example, in this particular graphic, the x-axis

19
00:00:56,550 --> 00:00:59,720
represents time, and the y-axis represents total number of

20
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:02,590
home runs hit. Whereas the coordinate system tells us what

21
00:01:02,590 --> 00:01:06,060
various dimensions of our visualization may correspond to, the

22
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:08,740
scale or data type will tell you where exactly your

23
00:01:08,740 --> 00:01:11,390
data needs to go. There are three types of

24
00:01:11,390 --> 00:01:16,520
scales that we could use: numeric, categorical and time series.

25
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:18,610
In this example, we're using numerical data on the

26
00:01:18,610 --> 00:01:21,830
y axis, the total number of home runs, and

27
00:01:21,830 --> 00:01:24,080
we have time on the x axis, the year.

28
00:01:25,410 --> 00:01:27,950
Note that both of them are a linear scale, so

29
00:01:27,950 --> 00:01:30,860
numbers are evenly spaced out. There are other type

30
00:01:30,860 --> 00:01:34,520
of scales, which we'll discuss later. And the final important

31
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:38,480
ingredient of an information visualization is context. So, if

32
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:41,710
your audience is unfamiliar with the data, it's your job

33
00:01:41,710 --> 00:01:45,270
to clarify what values in your graphic represent and explain

34
00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:48,610
to people how they should read your chart. So, in

35
00:01:48,610 --> 00:01:52,730
this particular visualization, I've provided some context by giving the

36
00:01:52,730 --> 00:01:56,450
chart a title. Number of NLB home runs by year.

37
00:01:56,450 --> 00:01:59,682
Labeling the axes, year and total home runs, and I

38
00:01:59,682 --> 00:02:02,260
could do a little bit more by annotating the chart

39
00:02:02,260 --> 00:02:04,820
potentially, so there are a variety of things that might

40
00:02:04,820 --> 00:02:06,720
inform the total number of home runs hit in a

41
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:10,240
particular year, maybe the beginning of the live ball

42
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:13,480
era, which we might put somewhere over here. The

43
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:16,780
crackdown on steroid use, which happens somewhere around the

44
00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:20,580
year 2000, et cetera. These annotations might help people

45
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:23,470
interpret this data and understand the story of, why

46
00:02:23,470 --> 00:02:25,230
the number of home runs hit by year is

47
00:02:25,230 --> 00:02:28,850
changing over time. It's important to emphasize that data

48
00:02:28,850 --> 00:02:31,450
is the driving force behind all four of these ingredients.
