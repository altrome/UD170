1
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:02,350
All right. Let's take a look at the code

2
00:00:02,350 --> 00:00:05,550
here. So first we create a pandas data frame

3
00:00:05,550 --> 00:00:10,880
called hr_year, that reads in the hr_year.csv file. Then

4
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:13,420
we just print ggplot where we say that our

5
00:00:13,420 --> 00:00:15,782
data source is going to be the hr_year data

6
00:00:15,782 --> 00:00:17,920
frame. And the variables that we want to plot are

7
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:21,920
year ID and home runs. Then we add geom

8
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:25,510
points, with the color red. Then we add geom

9
00:00:25,510 --> 00:00:27,850
lines to the color red and then let's add some

10
00:00:27,850 --> 00:00:31,310
labels so our plot is able to interpret. So we'll title

11
00:00:31,310 --> 00:00:34,990
it total home runs by year. With the x label year

12
00:00:34,990 --> 00:00:38,780
and the y label home runs. We just print this and

13
00:00:38,780 --> 00:00:42,690
we'll generate our chart. Now let's see what this produces.

14
00:00:42,690 --> 00:00:45,560
Here's the plot that this generates. We see that we have

15
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:47,850
a bunch of points that are red, where we indicate the

16
00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:50,690
number of home runs hit every year. They're connected by red

17
00:00:50,690 --> 00:00:52,630
lines, which gives us some sense of the rate of

18
00:00:52,630 --> 00:00:56,270
change. We have years on the X axis. Home runs on

19
00:00:56,270 --> 00:00:59,640
the Y axis. We have the labels that we put in.

20
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:01,820
And also the title that we told our plot to show.
