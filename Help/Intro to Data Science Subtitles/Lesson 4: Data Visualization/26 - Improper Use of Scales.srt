1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:01,910
The problem here is that the scale used

2
00:00:01,910 --> 00:00:05,860
here is inconsistent. Four stick people are originally used

3
00:00:05,860 --> 00:00:10,280
to represent 43,000 nurses. However, 28 stick people

4
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:12,565
are then used to represent an increase of just

5
00:00:12,565 --> 00:00:17,040
3,000 nurses. And then, just after that, about

6
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:19,300
eight stick people are used to represent an increase

7
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:22,300
of only about 1,000 nurses. As you can see,

8
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:25,870
this growth doesn't follow a linear or logarithmic scale.

9
00:00:25,870 --> 00:00:29,620
It's just kind of random, and it's very confusing to the reader.

10
00:00:29,620 --> 00:00:32,460
You'd look at this and think that the number of nurses exploded, but

11
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:36,460
it really only increased by 3,000. We can only assume that some kind

12
00:00:36,460 --> 00:00:37,670
of mistake was made here, that

13
00:00:37,670 --> 00:00:40,400
this doesn't efficiently communicate what's actually happening.
