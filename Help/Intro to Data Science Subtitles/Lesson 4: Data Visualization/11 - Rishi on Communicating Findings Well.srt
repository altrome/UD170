1
00:00:00,580 --> 00:00:04,220
In terms of communicating your findings and when

2
00:00:04,220 --> 00:00:06,430
you are a data scientist, you try, you tend

3
00:00:06,430 --> 00:00:08,166
to think in terms of code and in

4
00:00:08,166 --> 00:00:12,320
terms of ideas that are very mathematical etc. Or

5
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:15,790
statistical you do want to have the rigor,

6
00:00:15,790 --> 00:00:19,110
the mathematical and statistical rigor, but you also want

7
00:00:19,110 --> 00:00:21,570
to make it such that somebody who is not

8
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:25,690
familiar with that, may understand, what you're talking about.

9
00:00:25,690 --> 00:00:29,460
So, so make it into a story. Make it into something that is easily

10
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:33,080
understandable and communicable in English, for example.

11
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:36,100
Or, whichever language you prefer in your group.
