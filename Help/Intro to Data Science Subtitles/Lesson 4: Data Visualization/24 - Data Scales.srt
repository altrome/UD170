Now, let's talk about scales for categorical data. A

0:00:03.340,0:00:07.910
categorical scale provides visual separation for different groups. And it

0:00:07.910,0:00:10.750
often works in tandem with a numerical scale, as

0:00:10.750,0:00:12.495
we'll see here when we plot home runs on the

0:00:12.495,0:00:16.050
y-axis. A bar plot, for example, can use a

0:00:16.050,0:00:19.982
categorical scale on the x-axis, and a numerical scale on

0:00:19.982,0:00:22.690
the y-axis. So let's say that we were measuring home

0:00:22.690,0:00:26.070
runs by position. The positions we've used here are unordered,

0:00:26.070,0:00:27.940
but you can imagine that if we have ordinal

0:00:27.940,0:00:31.410
data, we'd want these categories represented in the order that

0:00:31.410,0:00:34.380
the ordinal data suggests. That will make it easier to

0:00:34.380,0:00:37.360
compare and contrast your bars, or whatever encoding that you've

0:00:37.360,0:00:41.010
chosen to represent your data. Finally, let's talk about

0:00:41.010,0:00:44.060
time series data. The thing is, we can measure time

0:00:44.060,0:00:47.910
with various different granularities. So we could use months or

0:00:47.910,0:00:51.230
days or years on this x-axis, which will let us

0:00:51.230,0:00:54.670
visualize our data in a discreet way. Depending

0:00:54.670,0:00:57.100
on what you're trying to communicate with your data

0:00:57.100,0:00:59.200
You might use a different time scale here.

0:00:59.200,0:01:01.390
So, if you're looking at fluctuations that happen on

0:01:01.390,0:01:03.780
a very short time scale, days are more

0:01:03.780,0:01:06.910
appropriate, but if we're looking at long term trends,

0:01:06.910,0:01:10.190
we may want to look at data on a month to month or year to year basis.
