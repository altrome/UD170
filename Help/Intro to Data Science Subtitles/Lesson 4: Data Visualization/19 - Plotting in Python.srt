00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:02,594
Lets assume that we have a csv file called

2
00:00:02,594 --> 00:00:08,840
hr_year.csv, which contains two columns, yearID and HR. YearID

3
00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:10,960
is the year and HR is the total number

4
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:13,970
of home runs. With these two columns, the csv file

5
00:00:13,970 --> 00:00:16,020
contains the number of home runs hit in Major

6
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:19,388
League Baseball every year. Can you write a function line

7
00:00:19,388 --> 00:00:22,196
plot that creates a pandas data frame from this

8
00:00:22,196 --> 00:00:25,508
csv file and then creates a chart with points connected

9
00:00:25,508 --> 00:00:28,460
by lines, both colored red, showing the number

10
00:00:28,460 --> 00:00:30,645
of home runs by year? You want to do this

11
00:00:30,645 --> 00:00:32,583
using the GG plot library with the syntax

12
00:00:32,583 --> 00:00:35,560
that we just discussed. Your code should go here.
