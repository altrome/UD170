00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:02,390
The success or failure of the models that you create

2
00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:06,870
is in a very large part determined by essentially what

3
00:00:06,870 --> 00:00:09,070
are you paying attention to about your data. So, this

4
00:00:09,070 --> 00:00:13,100
is the problem called feature selection. And I think that not

5
00:00:13,100 --> 00:00:16,520
enough time is spent in doing this. It's very, very

6
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:20,410
important so it's, in a lot of data science shops,

7
00:00:20,410 --> 00:00:23,210
it's very easy to just sort of take, records that

8
00:00:23,210 --> 00:00:26,830
come in, and then put them into a logistic regression, and

9
00:00:26,830 --> 00:00:28,660
you get some output, and then like, you can

10
00:00:28,660 --> 00:00:31,960
call it a day. and, you know, maybe often

11
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:33,570
times that could be enough to take you, like,

12
00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:37,210
you know, 50% of the way there. But really

13
00:00:37,210 --> 00:00:42,360
the difference between, like, a mediocre and a top-notch

14
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:45,440
shop, is like you have sat and thought about

15
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:47,730
what are the things to pay attention to? Like

16
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:51,850
should I synthesize these features into a new feature?

17
00:00:51,850 --> 00:00:53,690
Is there something new about this phenomenon that I

18
00:00:53,690 --> 00:00:57,410
should be capturing but haven't yet, haven't yet captured? So

19
00:00:57,410 --> 00:01:00,100
there's a lot of sort of there's a lot of

20
00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:03,750
process that goes into, just the feature selection process which

21
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:07,540
is, is hugely important. More advice, which just occurred to

22
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:11,310
me, is there's an additional, there's a world of tools

23
00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:14,950
out there that are not merely limited. so, so everything

24
00:01:14,950 --> 00:01:17,460
you would learn in the machine learning class is fantastic.

25
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:21,130
It forms a great foundation. Beyond there, there's

26
00:01:21,130 --> 00:01:24,140
a wealth of mathematical tools, and the more of

27
00:01:24,140 --> 00:01:25,650
them that you know, the more that it

28
00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:29,200
will help you. So things, for example, like differential

29
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:33,500
equations, or stochastic processes such as Markov chains.

30
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:38,870
Knowledge of these things allow you to break down

31
00:01:38,870 --> 00:01:40,650
a problem that you know nothing about. You

32
00:01:40,650 --> 00:01:42,430
can sort of break it down a little bit,

33
00:01:42,430 --> 00:01:44,260
a little bit further into pieces that give you

34
00:01:44,260 --> 00:01:47,740
just that extra bit of predictive ability or or insight

35
00:01:47,740 --> 00:01:49,450
into a problem. And the more tools that you

36
00:01:49,450 --> 00:01:53,150
have at your disposal the more it will help you.
