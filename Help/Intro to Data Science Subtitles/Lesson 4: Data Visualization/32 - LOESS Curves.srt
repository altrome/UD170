00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:03,050
If we waned to emphasize long term trends in our data,

2
00:00:03,050 --> 00:00:06,790
rather than year to year variability we might plot a loess curve

3
00:00:06,790 --> 00:00:10,910
over our data points. Loess is a form of weighted regression.

4
00:00:10,910 --> 00:00:12,990
We won't go into it too much in this course, but you

5
00:00:12,990 --> 00:00:16,030
can see here that it captures the overall trends in our

6
00:00:16,030 --> 00:00:19,630
Red Sox data rather than the year to year effects. So we

7
00:00:19,630 --> 00:00:22,370
see that the themes were getting better up until the 80s,

8
00:00:22,370 --> 00:00:25,530
got a bit worse in the 90s, and have continued to improve

9
00:00:25,530 --> 00:00:29,440
in the 2000s. Adding this line makes it easier to take a quick

10
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:32,549
look at our chart and come away with an understanding of the big

11
00:00:32,549 --> 00:00:35,600
picture. Where as if we just had the points or have the lines

12
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:39,240
connecting each point, it requires a little more heavy lifting by the viewer.
