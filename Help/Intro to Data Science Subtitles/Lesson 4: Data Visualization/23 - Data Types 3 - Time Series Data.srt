The final type of data we'll talk about is

0:00:01.930,0:00:05.070
time series data. Time series data is simply a

0:00:05.070,0:00:09.600
collection of observations obtained through repeated measurements over time.

0:00:09.600,0:00:12.590
In plain English, a time series is simply a sequence

0:00:12.590,0:00:15.450
of numbers collected at regular intervals over some period

0:00:15.450,0:00:19.500
of time. For example, we might measure the average number

0:00:19.500,0:00:22.600
of home runs per players for many different years.

0:00:22.600,0:00:26.020
Time series data is not so different from numerical data.

0:00:26.020,0:00:28.800
The real difference here is that rather then having a

0:00:28.800,0:00:32.159
bunch of numerical values which don't have any time ordering,

0:00:32.159,0:00:35.560
time series data does have some implied ordering. There's a

0:00:35.560,0:00:38.170
first data point collected and a last data point collected.
