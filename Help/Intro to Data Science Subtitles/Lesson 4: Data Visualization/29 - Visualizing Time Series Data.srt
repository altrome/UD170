1
00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:03,440
All right. Now that we've learned the basics of visual

2
00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:06,780
cues, different data types, and different skills that we might

3
00:00:06,780 --> 00:00:09,720
use to plot those data types. Why don't we focus

4
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:12,940
in more on time series data? Since that's the format

5
00:00:12,940 --> 00:00:15,390
that our New York City subway data and weather data

6
00:00:15,390 --> 00:00:18,480
will come in. We'll discuss different things we can include

7
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:21,430
in the plot for time series data Starting with something

8
00:00:21,430 --> 00:00:25,560
simple like a scatterplot, and adding more complex features like

9
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:29,350
maybe a Louis curve. With each iteration, we'll

10
00:00:29,350 --> 00:00:31,870
show how we can combine visual cues, data

11
00:00:31,870 --> 00:00:34,300
types, and appropriate scales in our charts to

12
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:38,420
achieve visual excellence. Again, why don't we use baseball

13
00:00:38,420 --> 00:00:40,960
data as an example. Let's plot the winning

14
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:43,400
percentage of my least favorite team as a

15
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:47,020
Yankees fan, the Boston Red Sox, from 1960

16
00:00:47,020 --> 00:00:50,490
until 2010. Let's start with a simple scatter plot.
