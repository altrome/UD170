00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:02,520
To get started, let's answer the question,

2
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:06,550
what is information visualization? Information visualization is

3
00:00:06,550 --> 00:00:10,430
the effective communication of complex quantitative ideas.

4
00:00:10,430 --> 00:00:12,310
This is usually done through geometry and

5
00:00:12,310 --> 00:00:14,540
color. What do we mean by an

6
00:00:14,540 --> 00:00:18,490
effective communication? Well, an effective communication is

7
00:00:18,490 --> 00:00:22,180
the expression of ideas with clarity, precision,

8
00:00:22,180 --> 00:00:25,150
and efficiency. An effective visualization will let

9
00:00:25,150 --> 00:00:27,150
you see things that might go unnoticed if you

10
00:00:27,150 --> 00:00:30,500
didn't visualize the data. Any data set contains tons of

11
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:33,490
information but you might missed out on trends, behavior

12
00:00:33,490 --> 00:00:37,150
patterns, and dependencies if you don't visualize it. Additionally, an

13
00:00:37,150 --> 00:00:41,060
effective visualization can highlight certain trends in the data

14
00:00:41,060 --> 00:00:43,090
or tell a story to people who might be looking

15
00:00:43,090 --> 00:00:46,120
at the visualization. So why don't we take a look

16
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:50,200
at an all time classic visualization of information, Charles Minard's

17
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:52,670
graphical depiction of the terrible fate of

18
00:00:52,670 --> 00:00:54,640
Napoleon's army when they marched on Russia.
