Alright, so we've identified what information this graphic is

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,480
communicating. But, you could probably imagine a really bad

3
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:09,320
graphic that had all the same information. You might

4
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:11,640
look at it and have no idea what's going on.

5
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:14,390
Or, it might not tell the story as effectively.

6
00:00:14,390 --> 00:00:18,300
What makes this graphic so effective? Can we quantify

7
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:22,680
effective information visualization down to a few important ingredients?

8
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:25,640
I'd like to hear your thoughts again. In your perspective,

9
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:28,470
what are the ingredients to good information visualization? This

10
00:00:28,470 --> 00:00:31,200
is a free-form question, so there's no right or

11
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:35,070
wrong answer. Type your answer in this text box.

12
00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:36,730
I'll share my thoughts with you in the next video.
