My name is Don Dini. I'm a principle data scientist here at the AT&T big

0:00:04.840,0:00:08.130
data group. My background is in computer

0:00:08.130,0:00:12.170
science in artificial intelligence specifically multi agent systems.

0:00:12.170,0:00:17.190
Before that, I did physics but then I got, I got struck over the head

0:00:17.190,0:00:19.390
with the magic of computer science. And I

0:00:19.390,0:00:22.020
moved into there, and into our visual intelligence.

0:00:24.210,0:00:30.220
And then I taught for a while at USC, and then

0:00:30.220,0:00:35.900
moving up here to the Bay area and worked for a couple of start ups. Doing a lot

0:00:35.900,0:00:41.700
of work on real time system for collecting data

0:00:41.700,0:00:46.950
and doing real time analysis on them. And and now I am here.
