As we mentioned in the previous video, visual cues are

2
00:00:03,380 --> 00:00:06,490
one of the main ingredients to an effective visualization. In the

3
00:00:06,490 --> 00:00:08,780
next couple of videos, we'll cover some of the main

4
00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:11,410
visual cues that you can use to represent data in your

5
00:00:11,410 --> 00:00:14,100
charts. The first one that we're going to discuss is

6
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:18,730
position. When using position as a visual cue, you compute value

7
00:00:18,730 --> 00:00:21,110
by looking at the position of a point compared to

8
00:00:21,110 --> 00:00:24,900
the position of others in the same space or coordinate system.

9
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:27,670
Here, this would translate to this point's x and

10
00:00:27,670 --> 00:00:30,760
y coordinate. Position is useful in coding because it

11
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:34,240
takes up less space than other visual cues. It's

12
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:38,180
really space efficient. Each data point is simply represented as

13
00:00:38,180 --> 00:00:41,480
a dot. Also, points often have the same size

14
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:45,530
which allows you to easily identify trends, clusters, and outliers

15
00:00:45,530 --> 00:00:48,180
by plotting all of your data at once. But

16
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:50,200
if you have too many data points in your plot,

17
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:52,620
it can be a challenge to identify what each

18
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:56,420
point represents. For example, imagine that this chart were covered

19
00:00:56,420 --> 00:00:59,680
with dozens of green dots just like this one. It

20
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:02,230
might be hard for us to identify individual dots and

21
00:01:02,230 --> 00:01:04,680
really understand what they mean, or what day do they

22
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:09,230
correspond to. Another commonly used visual cue is length, which

23
00:01:09,230 --> 00:01:12,400
is often encountered in the form of bar charts. The

24
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:15,400
length of a bar indicates the intensity or value of

25
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:18,480
your data point. For example, the longer the bar,

26
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:21,610
the greater the absolute value. One more encoding that's

27
00:01:21,610 --> 00:01:25,750
very common is angle. Angle ranges from 0 to

28
00:01:25,750 --> 00:01:28,750
360 degrees on a circle. Angles are commonly used to

29
00:01:28,750 --> 00:01:31,260
represent parts of a whole. A pie chart is

30
00:01:31,260 --> 00:01:33,630
a really common example of this. The sum of

31
00:01:33,630 --> 00:01:35,760
the wedges in this pie complete a circle and

32
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:40,580
give us 360 degrees. One negative aspect to using angles

33
00:01:40,580 --> 00:01:42,830
as a visual encoding is that human eyes can have a

34
00:01:42,830 --> 00:01:46,370
difficult time differentiating angles. For example,

35
00:01:46,370 --> 00:01:48,090
25 degrees and 30 degrees may

36
00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:51,905
look very similar. Because of this, angle is an encoding that you

37
00:01:51,905 --> 00:01:55,104
may want to avoid if you're trying to show very small differences.

38
00:01:55,104 --> 00:01:57,750
