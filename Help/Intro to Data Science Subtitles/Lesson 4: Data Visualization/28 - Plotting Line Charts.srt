1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:02,020
So first we're going to make a pandas

2
00:00:02,020 --> 00:00:04,750
data frame. Again, I'm going to call it hr year.

3
00:00:04,750 --> 00:00:07,895
That will read in hr by team year sf

4
00:00:07,895 --> 00:00:11,100
ls.csv. Then we'll create our ggplot. So we'll say

5
00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:14,470
print ggplot hr year, and note that we say

6
00:00:14,470 --> 00:00:18,300
aes yearID, HR, and then we set color equal

7
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:21,680
to teamID. Then we're going to add geometric points

8
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:25,020
and geometric lines, but not pass on a color.

9
00:00:25,020 --> 00:00:27,860
Otherwise this is very similar to our basic plot, which

10
00:00:27,860 --> 00:00:31,590
didn't have different lines and points for different teams. Let's

11
00:00:31,590 --> 00:00:34,490
see what this creates when we actually run it. As

12
00:00:34,490 --> 00:00:36,860
you can see we have here a chart which compares the

13
00:00:36,860 --> 00:00:39,402
total number of home runs hit per year, for the

14
00:00:39,402 --> 00:00:43,830
L.A. Dodgers, called here LAN for LA National League. And

15
00:00:43,830 --> 00:00:47,150
the San Francisco Giants, called here SFN for San Francisco

16
00:00:47,150 --> 00:00:50,380
National League. We have two different sets of points and lines

17
00:00:50,380 --> 00:00:54,170
which are color coded according to team, and we're able to compare how the

18
00:00:54,170 --> 00:00:57,100
total number of home runs hit have varied by year for the two teams.
