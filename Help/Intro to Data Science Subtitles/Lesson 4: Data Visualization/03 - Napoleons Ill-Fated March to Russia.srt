00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:02,790
Alright, so, here's a little bit of background on

2
00:00:02,790 --> 00:00:07,670
this visualization. Napoleon invaded Russia in 1812, and suffered

3
00:00:07,670 --> 00:00:11,110
a number of devastating losses. So Charles Minard created

4
00:00:11,110 --> 00:00:14,240
this chart to describe the sheer amount of loss

5
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:18,590
that Napoleon caused in a simple, yet powerful graphic.

6
00:00:18,590 --> 00:00:19,760
So if we start at the left of the

7
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:22,340
graphic, we are at the Polish Russian border near

8
00:00:22,340 --> 00:00:25,445
the Neman River. And this flow line shows the size

9
00:00:25,445 --> 00:00:29,020
of Napoleon's grand army 422,000 as they invaded Russia

10
00:00:29,020 --> 00:00:32,890
of June of 1812. The width of this band indicates

11
00:00:32,890 --> 00:00:34,380
the size of the army at each place of

12
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:38,450
the map. In September when the army finally reached Moscow,

13
00:00:38,450 --> 00:00:41,440
it had dwindled to 100,000 men. The path of

14
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:44,770
Napoleon's retreat from Moscow is depicted by this lower, darker

15
00:00:44,770 --> 00:00:47,630
band which is linked to a temperature scale which is

16
00:00:47,630 --> 00:00:50,520
hanging down here. And also these dates that we see

17
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:52,970
at the bottom of the chart. It was incredibly

18
00:00:52,970 --> 00:00:54,960
cold, and many froze on the march out of

19
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:57,400
Russia. This chart shows that the crossing of the

20
00:00:57,400 --> 00:01:00,460
Berezina River was a disaster. And the army struggled back

21
00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:03,630
to Poland with only 10,000 men remaining. Menard made

22
00:01:03,630 --> 00:01:06,380
this plot to really highlight the huge amount of loss

23
00:01:06,380 --> 00:01:09,280
that was caused by Napoleon's march on Russia. Look

24
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:12,370
at how many men died marching to and from Moscow.
