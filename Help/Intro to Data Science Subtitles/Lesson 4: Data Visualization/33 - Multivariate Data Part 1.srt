0:00:00.190,0:00:02.430
All right. So it's great that we can visualize the

0:00:02.430,0:00:05.610
winning percentage of the Red Sox from 1960 to 2010.

0:00:05.610,0:00:08.189
But what if we wanted to do a slightly more

0:00:08.189,0:00:11.170
complex analysis to try to understand what is driving that

0:00:11.170,0:00:15.400
winning percentage. We'd have to incorporate more variables. But how?

0:00:16.420,0:00:18.600
One way is that we can use the visual cues

0:00:18.600,0:00:21.460
that we're familiar with to encode even more information into

0:00:21.460,0:00:25.170
the chart. For example, let's go back to our scatter chart.

0:00:25.170,0:00:27.800
We can use the size of the points to represent the number

0:00:27.800,0:00:31.510
of home runs hit by the Red Sox players that year. Dots

0:00:31.510,0:00:34.840
that are larger meant that more home runs were hit that year

0:00:34.840,0:00:38.720
whereas smaller dots mean that fewer home runs were hit. Hopefully, what

0:00:38.720,0:00:41.410
we would see is that bigger dots occur when the winning percentage

0:00:41.410,0:00:44.730
is higher. I've filled the plot in with some dummy data just

0:00:44.730,0:00:47.140
so that you have an idea of what this might look like.

0:00:47.140,0:00:50.340
We can even double up on visual cues. For example maybe we

0:00:50.340,0:00:53.480
also use the saturation of the red color to indicate

0:00:53.480,0:00:56.490
how many home runs are hit. So our larger dots

0:00:56.490,0:00:59.890
will be a more intense shade of red, whereas our

0:00:59.890,0:01:02.870
smaller dots will be a less intense maybe almost pink shade

0:01:02.870,0:01:06.500
of red. A redundant visual cue can help reinforce what

0:01:06.500,0:01:08.910
might be a challenge to see if we only used one

0:01:08.910,0:01:12.420
visual cue. So by using both size and color here,

0:01:12.420,0:01:15.370
hopefully we really hammer home to the viewer that there were

0:01:15.370,0:01:17.230
more or fewer home runs in a given year.
