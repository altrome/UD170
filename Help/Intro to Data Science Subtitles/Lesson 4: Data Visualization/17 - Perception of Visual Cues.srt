In 1985, two scientists from AT&T labs published

2
00:00:04,010 --> 00:00:07,310
a paper on graphical perception and methods. The study

3
00:00:07,310 --> 00:00:10,060
determined how accurately people read the visual cues that

4
00:00:10,060 --> 00:00:13,080
are presented here. This resulted in a ranked list

5
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:16,140
of most accurate to least accurate visual cues. So

6
00:00:16,140 --> 00:00:19,390
you can see that position is more accurate. Where

7
00:00:19,390 --> 00:00:22,930
as hue is less accurate. What does accuracy mean

8
00:00:22,930 --> 00:00:25,580
here? Well, in this case, it just means how

9
00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:27,970
easily are people able to perceive the values in

10
00:00:27,970 --> 00:00:30,500
your data set given the visual encoding that you've

11
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:33,380
chosen. You might wonder why saturation and hue are

12
00:00:33,380 --> 00:00:37,590
considered inaccurate. Well, this is a great example. One should

13
00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:39,650
be a little bit cautious when using color, hues

14
00:00:39,650 --> 00:00:43,230
and saturation as visual cues. Like all aspects of

15
00:00:43,230 --> 00:00:46,780
visual perception, we don't perceive color in an absolute

16
00:00:46,780 --> 00:00:50,690
manner. For example, these are all different shades of gray.

17
00:00:50,690 --> 00:00:53,570
When trying to compare and contrast them, it's difficult to

18
00:00:53,570 --> 00:00:57,490
know which shades of gray correspond to exactly which values,

19
00:00:57,490 --> 00:01:00,210
or just how much darker one shade of gray is

20
00:01:00,210 --> 00:01:03,630
than another. For this reason, it's really hard for viewers of

21
00:01:03,630 --> 00:01:05,930
your visualization to really know what a different shade of

22
00:01:05,930 --> 00:01:09,020
gray might mean. How much bigger is one data point

23
00:01:09,020 --> 00:01:12,090
than another? Because of this, you should be careful when

24
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:16,780
using color, hues and saturation, to encode information in your visualization.

25
00:01:16,780 --> 00:01:19,750
This ranking up here is really a oversimplification of

26
00:01:19,750 --> 00:01:23,010
how visualization works. So you should really use it as

27
00:01:23,010 --> 00:01:26,490
a guide, rather than a definitive rule buck. Efficiency and

28
00:01:26,490 --> 00:01:30,650
exactness are not always the goal of our visualization. Sometimes

29
00:01:30,650 --> 00:01:33,630
color, saturation or color, hue or volume or area can

30
00:01:33,630 --> 00:01:35,850
be really effective to communicate what we are trying to

31
00:01:35,850 --> 00:01:39,380
tell the viewer. However it's good to know generally how

32
00:01:39,380 --> 00:01:41,850
well people will be able to read different visual cues.
