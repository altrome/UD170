1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:03,190
So we've talked about visual cues to encode and represent

2
00:00:03,190 --> 00:00:06,360
your data. Another thing we consider is the different types

3
00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:10,062
of data that are available. Most data can be categorized

4
00:00:10,062 --> 00:00:13,660
into 3 basic types. In fact, we've seen all 3

5
00:00:13,660 --> 00:00:15,320
types of this data during our walk through of the

6
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:19,330
baseball data without explicitly referring to them as such. The

7
00:00:19,330 --> 00:00:22,690
first of these types is numeric data. Numeric data as

8
00:00:22,690 --> 00:00:25,530
you might expect, is any data where our data points

9
00:00:25,530 --> 00:00:28,180
are exact numbers. These data have meaning as

10
00:00:28,180 --> 00:00:30,730
a measurement such as a baseball player's height

11
00:00:30,730 --> 00:00:36,260
or weight or as a count, such as number of hits or home runs for a player

12
00:00:36,260 --> 00:00:37,490
or how many players there are on a

13
00:00:37,490 --> 00:00:43,160
team. Statisticians also might call numerical data, quantitative data.

14
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:46,030
Numerical data can be characterized into discrete or

15
00:00:46,030 --> 00:00:50,750
continuous data. Discreet data has distinct values whereas continuous

16
00:00:50,750 --> 00:00:53,450
data can assume any value within a range. For

17
00:00:53,450 --> 00:00:55,890
example, a player's number of home runs would be

18
00:00:55,890 --> 00:00:58,830
a discreet data set. You can only have discreet

19
00:00:58,830 --> 00:01:01,504
whole number values like 10, 25, or 34. A

20
00:01:01,504 --> 00:01:07,390
player cannot for example, hit 14.375 home runs. A

21
00:01:07,390 --> 00:01:09,640
player either hits a home run or he doesn't.

22
00:01:10,660 --> 00:01:12,910
On the other hand, continuous data are numbers that

23
00:01:12,910 --> 00:01:15,822
can fall anywhere within a range. Like a player's

24
00:01:15,822 --> 00:01:19,480
batting average which falls between 0 and 1000. So

25
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:21,440
a player could have a batting average of 0.250, they

26
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:25,442
could also have a batting average of 0.357 or

27
00:01:25,442 --> 00:01:30,050
0.511. And so again just to hammer this home, examples

28
00:01:30,050 --> 00:01:32,960
of numeric data might be a baseball player's height

29
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:35,470
or weight or their number of home runs or a

30
00:01:35,470 --> 00:01:38,040
number of hits or a number of doubles. The

31
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:40,910
take away here is that this is data that are

32
00:01:40,910 --> 00:01:43,540
numbers and they are not ordered in

33
00:01:43,540 --> 00:01:45,470
time. They're just numbers that we've collected.
