1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:03,350
Categorical data represents characteristics, such as a

2
00:00:03,350 --> 00:00:08,920
player's position, team, hometown or even, handedness. Categorical

3
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:12,050
data can take on numerical values. For example,

4
00:00:12,050 --> 00:00:14,380
maybe we'd use 1 for first baseman and

5
00:00:14,380 --> 00:00:16,940
2 for second baseman. But these numbers

6
00:00:16,940 --> 00:00:19,850
don't have a mathematical meaning. That is, we

7
00:00:19,850 --> 00:00:22,700
can't add them together or take the average.

8
00:00:22,700 --> 00:00:25,520
There's also something called ordinal data, which in

9
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:27,290
some sense is a mix of numerical and

10
00:00:27,290 --> 00:00:31,120
categorical data. In ordinal data, the data still falls

11
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:34,210
into categories, but those categories have some order or

12
00:00:34,210 --> 00:00:37,425
ranking. For example, a scout might rank a baseball

13
00:00:37,425 --> 00:00:39,770
player's power on a scale from very low to

14
00:00:39,770 --> 00:00:43,350
very high. Another example is that you might give

15
00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:46,470
a movie anywhere between 1 star and 5 stars

16
00:00:46,470 --> 00:00:50,250
and these might be ordinal categories. For plotting purposes,

17
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:54,320
ordinal data is treated much in the same way as categorical data. But the

18
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:56,100
groups are usually ordered from lowest to

19
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:58,360
highest, so that we can preserve this ordering.
