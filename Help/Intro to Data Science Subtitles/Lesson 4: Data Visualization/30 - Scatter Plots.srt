1
00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:03,407
Let's start with a simple scatter plot. Each dot

2
00:00:03,407 --> 00:00:07,099
in this chart represents the winning percentage of the Boston

3
00:00:07,099 --> 00:00:10,346
Red Sox in the year between 1960 and 2010. In

4
00:00:10,346 --> 00:00:12,942
this chart, the main visual cue that we're using is

5
00:00:12,942 --> 00:00:16,896
position. The year for our particular winning percentage is dictated

6
00:00:16,896 --> 00:00:19,590
by where we are in the x coordinate. And we

7
00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:21,530
see what the winning percentage is by looking at a

8
00:00:21,530 --> 00:00:25,400
data point's position on the y-axis. Secondly, we can note

9
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:28,290
that this plot provides pretty good context. We

10
00:00:28,290 --> 00:00:31,336
have an X labeled Year, indicating what the x-axis

11
00:00:31,336 --> 00:00:34,620
represents. A Y labelled Winning Percentage, telling us what

12
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:38,060
the y-axis represents. And we have a pretty descriptive

13
00:00:38,060 --> 00:00:41,410
title. Boston Red Sox Winning Percentage. We might

14
00:00:41,410 --> 00:00:44,320
include by year to make it even better. This

15
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:46,840
will help people who are unfamiliar with this data

16
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:48,900
really look at this chart and understand what's happening.

17
00:00:50,130 --> 00:00:54,040
But as you can see, a scatter plot here really puts focus on the individual

18
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:59,640
values. It's a little bit hard to discern trends. It could also be hard for a

19
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:01,840
reader to mentally fill in the gaps between

20
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:03,910
the points and really understand what's happening from

21
00:01:03,910 --> 00:01:08,620
year to year. It's for this reason that we might want to use a line chart.
