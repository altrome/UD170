0:00:00.380,0:00:03.450
So, to mitigate the shortcomings of a scatter plot, we can

0:00:03.450,0:00:05.950
plot the same data as a line chart, and connect the

0:00:05.950,0:00:09.750
dots with lines, as we see in this image. Putting lines

0:00:09.750,0:00:13.240
here really emphasizes trends. So, as we can see, there was

0:00:13.240,0:00:16.810
a pretty bad series of Red Sox teams in the 90s.

0:00:16.810,0:00:18.860
And that the Red Sox teams have been doing pretty well

0:00:18.860,0:00:22.090
in the 2000s. It's a little bit harder to see this

0:00:22.090,0:00:25.860
when we just have the points without the lines. That being said,

0:00:25.860,0:00:27.850
having lines that connect each point really puts

0:00:27.850,0:00:30.550
a focus on year to year variability. We

0:00:30.550,0:00:32.980
can see, for example that from 1964 to

0:00:32.980,0:00:36.940
1965, there's a huge drop. But it's a little

0:00:36.940,0:00:38.840
bit harder to have a good sense of

0:00:38.840,0:00:41.970
the more global trends. Are the teams getting better

0:00:41.970,0:00:44.560
or worse on average? For this reason, we

0:00:44.560,0:00:47.100
might introduce a lowest curve instead of these lines.
