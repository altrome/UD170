00:00:01,310 --> 00:00:02,790
Now that we've discussed it from different visual

2
00:00:02,790 --> 00:00:05,440
cues and different data types, as well as the

3
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:07,850
scales to use for those data types, why

4
00:00:07,850 --> 00:00:10,650
don't we circle back to making graphs with ggplot

5
00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:14,540
and try to do something a bit more advanced. This time, we'll want to write a

6
00:00:14,540 --> 00:00:18,775
function lineplot_compare, that will rad in a CSV file called

7
00:00:18,775 --> 00:00:27,190
hr_by_team_year_sf_la.csv. This file contains 3 columns - yearID, HR,

8
00:00:27,190 --> 00:00:30,240
and teamID, which represent the total number of

9
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:32,490
home runs hit each year by either the San

10
00:00:32,490 --> 00:00:36,770
Francisco Giants or the LA Dodgers. Why don't you

11
00:00:36,770 --> 00:00:39,450
produce a visualization comparing the total home runs hit

12
00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:42,660
by year for the 2 teams. Note that to

13
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:45,610
differentiate between multiple categories on the same plot in

14
00:00:45,610 --> 00:00:48,420
ggplot, we can pass color in with the other

15
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:52,900
arguments to aes rather than in our geometry functions.

16
00:00:52,900 --> 00:00:57,995
For example we could say ggplot data aes xvar, yvar, and then

17
00:00:57,995 --> 00:01:03,933
color=catetory_var This should help you to make this chart. Your code goes here.
