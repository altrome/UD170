00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:02,370
So far in this course, we've discussed how to

2
00:00:02,370 --> 00:00:06,380
acquire, munge, and analyze data. These are all really important

3
00:00:06,380 --> 00:00:09,520
skill sets for a data scientist to have. However,

4
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:12,920
an equally important skill is the ability to communicate your

5
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:16,820
findings. Sure, this can be done through a presentation

6
00:00:16,820 --> 00:00:19,350
or through a blog post. But, one of the most

7
00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:21,860
effective ways to communicate your findings is through a data

8
00:00:21,860 --> 00:00:25,870
visualization. During this lesson we'll be focusing on the basics

9
00:00:25,870 --> 00:00:28,620
of data visualization. We'll talk about how to use

10
00:00:28,620 --> 00:00:32,049
a variety of visual cues to encode information and also

11
00:00:32,049 --> 00:00:34,990
how to make concise and effective visualizations that really

12
00:00:34,990 --> 00:00:38,850
communicate what you're trying to say. We'll also go over

13
00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:40,690
how to make some of these different types of

14
00:00:40,690 --> 00:00:44,660
visualizations in Python. Once you have these skills, you'll be

15
00:00:44,660 --> 00:00:47,370
able to take the findings that we've accumulated about the

16
00:00:47,370 --> 00:00:50,880
New York City subway system. And really make effective visualizations

17
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:53,570
that communicate these findings either to your friends, or your

18
00:00:53,570 --> 00:00:57,710
family. Or, anyone else. All right, why don't we begin?
