00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:02,560
In this lesson, we've discussed some of the basic skills

2
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:03,890
necessary to make an effective

3
00:00:03,890 --> 00:00:06,660
information visualization. We've talked about some

4
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:09,280
of the best ways to visually encode data, and also

5
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:11,720
some of the most effective methods for charting different types of

6
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:15,100
data. We've also gone over the basics of making visualizations

7
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:19,460
in Python. If you find the individualization really interesting, I'd strongly

8
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:21,770
encourage you to look at some blogs or websites that

9
00:00:21,770 --> 00:00:25,380
aggregate some of the most interesting data visualizations. It's not hard

10
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:29,180
to find them. Just go to Google, type in data visualization, and you'll come

11
00:00:29,180 --> 00:00:32,170
across some really interesting stuff. You'll use

12
00:00:32,170 --> 00:00:34,150
this new found data visualization know how to

13
00:00:34,150 --> 00:00:36,480
make some really interesting graphics that communicate

14
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:38,620
our findings so far about subway ridership in

15
00:00:38,620 --> 00:00:42,230
New York City. I'll be really interested to see what you guys come up with.
