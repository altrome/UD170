Alright, so we've talked about how proper scales

0:00:02.860,0:00:06.000
can help present data more effectively, but why don't

0:00:06.000,0:00:07.840
we look at an example where scales are not

0:00:07.840,0:00:11.810
used well? When used incorrectly, scales can misguide or

0:00:11.810,0:00:15.260
confuse readers. This visualization from New South Wales shows

0:00:15.260,0:00:19.070
that the NSW health system is recruiting more nurses.

0:00:19.070,0:00:20.880
But, I can tell you it's not a good

0:00:20.880,0:00:25.250
visualization. Can you tell why? Enter your answer in
