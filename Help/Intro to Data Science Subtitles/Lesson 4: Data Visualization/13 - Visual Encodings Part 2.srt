00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:03,420
Let's discuss a few more visual cues, the

2
00:00:03,420 --> 00:00:06,380
first of which is going to be direction. Direction

3
00:00:06,380 --> 00:00:09,410
is similar to angle, but the direction encoding relies

4
00:00:09,410 --> 00:00:12,130
on a single vector's orientation in a coordinate system.

5
00:00:13,190 --> 00:00:15,401
By looking at the slope of a given line,

6
00:00:15,401 --> 00:00:19,153
we can easily see increases, decreases, or fluctuations within

7
00:00:19,153 --> 00:00:22,480
our data. However, direction is tricky for many of

8
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:25,270
the same reasons that angle is tricky. We can

9
00:00:25,270 --> 00:00:29,050
easily differentiate a horizontal or vertical line, but when

10
00:00:29,050 --> 00:00:31,240
we're dealing with lines with angles it's harder to

11
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:33,660
see the difference between two that are both negative

12
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:36,990
or positive. Another encoding that can be used is

13
00:00:36,990 --> 00:00:40,680
shape. Shapes and symbols are commonly used to differentiate

14
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:43,980
categories of objects. For example, say that we had

15
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:47,190
a scatter plot. We could use triangles and squares

16
00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:50,140
to show trends for two different types of data,

17
00:00:50,140 --> 00:00:52,940
say two different baseball teams, or two different

18
00:00:52,940 --> 00:00:56,630
districts in our Aadhaar data, something like that. We

19
00:00:56,630 --> 00:00:58,920
can also use the area or volume of our

20
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:03,270
shapes to encode information. So bigger objects typically represent

21
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:07,120
greater values. Like length, when we encode information within

22
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:10,060
an area or a volume, we are basically representing

23
00:01:10,060 --> 00:01:12,830
our data with size. So, say we were using

24
00:01:12,830 --> 00:01:15,420
circles. The greater the value of the data point,

25
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:16,810
the bigger our circle is going to be.
