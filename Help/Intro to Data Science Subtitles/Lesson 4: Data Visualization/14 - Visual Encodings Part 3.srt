1
00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:02,430
We can also encode data into our

2
00:00:02,430 --> 00:00:06,922
visualization using color. We can typically include

3
00:00:06,922 --> 00:00:09,710
values with color in 2 different ways,

4
00:00:09,710 --> 00:00:12,900
hue and saturation. They can be used individually

5
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:19,550
or in combination. Color hue is what we typically refer to as color like red

6
00:00:19,550 --> 00:00:22,880
or green or blue. Different colors used

7
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:25,450
together usually in the key categorical data where

8
00:00:25,450 --> 00:00:28,610
each color represents different group. So if we're

9
00:00:28,610 --> 00:00:31,270
using our baseball data maybe green is short

10
00:00:31,270 --> 00:00:34,880
stops, red is outfielders and orange is second

11
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:39,170
basemen, something like that. Saturation is the intensity of

12
00:00:39,170 --> 00:00:44,400
color for a given hue. So if you select a color as blue, high saturation will be

13
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:47,340
very blue and the color would look faded

14
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:51,150
as you decrease your saturation. We usually use saturation

15
00:00:51,150 --> 00:00:55,280
to encode intensity or quantity of a value. So

16
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:57,210
maybe if we were encoding the number of home runs

17
00:00:57,210 --> 00:01:00,940
with saturation, more home runs would be darker and fewer

18
00:01:00,940 --> 00:01:04,069
home runs would lighter. Or, if we were encoding Aadhaar

19
00:01:04,069 --> 00:01:07,340
enrollments, more enrollments would be darker and fewer enrollments

20
00:01:07,340 --> 00:01:10,240
would be lighter. We could also use hue and saturation

21
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:13,710
in combination. So you can see here that no hue

22
00:01:13,710 --> 00:01:16,220
and no saturation is set to 0 and in this

23
00:01:16,220 --> 00:01:20,700
particular encoding, the more saturated our purple-like color is,

24
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:23,380
the more negative we are. And the more saturated

25
00:01:23,380 --> 00:01:26,690
our green-like color is, the more positive we are.

26
00:01:26,690 --> 00:01:30,250
This might accentuate the differences in value and tell

27
00:01:30,250 --> 00:01:32,540
us when the value is positive or negative and

28
00:01:32,540 --> 00:01:35,990
how intense the absolute value of that effect is.

29
00:01:35,990 --> 00:01:39,170
When using color to encode information, a pretty good

30
00:01:39,170 --> 00:01:41,230
general rule of thumb is that you shouldn't use more

31
00:01:41,230 --> 00:01:44,590
than a dozen colors to encode categories effectively. If

32
00:01:44,590 --> 00:01:46,900
you were to use more than 12 colors, it might

33
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:49,700
be hard to quickly differentiate between categories, and your visualization

34
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:52,070
is going to become a little bit harder to parse.
