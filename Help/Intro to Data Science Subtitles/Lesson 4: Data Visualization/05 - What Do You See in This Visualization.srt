This visualization packs a lot of information into

2
00:00:02,740 --> 00:00:05,120
a small area. So, here are some of the

3
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:08,240
details that are communicated. We know the size of

4
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:11,230
Napoleon's army. We know the location of the army

5
00:00:11,230 --> 00:00:14,010
at various points in time. The color coding on

6
00:00:14,010 --> 00:00:16,090
the march into and out of Moscow tells us

7
00:00:16,090 --> 00:00:18,830
the direction of the army's movement. And we're also

8
00:00:18,830 --> 00:00:21,410
shown the temperature on various dates during Napoleon's retreat.
