1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:02,140
All right. So why don't we recap what

2
00:00:02,140 --> 00:00:05,580
we've discussed in this lesson. First, we discussed

3
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:09,450
the components to an effective information visualization. They

4
00:00:09,450 --> 00:00:13,490
were visual cues, the coordinate system, the scale and

5
00:00:13,490 --> 00:00:16,440
data types, and the context. After that, we

6
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:18,090
dived a little bit deeper into the various

7
00:00:18,090 --> 00:00:20,189
different ways that we can encode data visually.

8
00:00:21,290 --> 00:00:25,050
These included its size, position, color, and many more.

9
00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:30,058
We also discussed various scales and data types such as numerical,

10
00:00:30,058 --> 00:00:35,240
categorical, and time-series. We took

11
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:37,360
a deeper dive into time-series, since that's what

12
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:38,980
most of the data for our assignment will look

13
00:00:38,980 --> 00:00:41,470
like. And finally, we went over the basics

14
00:00:41,470 --> 00:00:44,490
of creating graphics using ggplot, a library for

15
00:00:44,490 --> 00:00:47,740
Python. For this week's assignment, you'll use what

16
00:00:47,740 --> 00:00:50,150
we've learned in this lesson. That is the basic

17
00:00:50,150 --> 00:00:53,230
principles of data visualization and the basics of

18
00:00:53,230 --> 00:00:56,340
how to create a graphic in ggplot. You'll create

19
00:00:56,340 --> 00:00:59,100
a few basic visualizations that describe things about the

20
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:02,170
New York City subway. So, you'll want to communicate to

21
00:01:02,170 --> 00:01:06,930
people our statistical findings from assignment 3, but also

22
00:01:06,930 --> 00:01:11,240
maybe just some general information regarding the subway. Ridership

23
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:13,960
at various hours of the day, how many people

24
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:16,264
are going into and out of different stations, etc.
