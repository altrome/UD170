1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:03,580
So I think my experience has been that

2
00:00:03,580 --> 00:00:06,760
human beings are hard wired to receive things in

3
00:00:06,760 --> 00:00:10,570
story form. So if you can craft a narrative

4
00:00:10,570 --> 00:00:13,060
behind what you are doing, it makes it easy

5
00:00:13,060 --> 00:00:17,670
to, it makes it it makes it more compelling.

6
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:19,530
And you know, it doesn't have to be you

7
00:00:19,530 --> 00:00:21,360
know, like a coming of age story or anything

8
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:25,560
like that. It could simply be like like there

9
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:28,980
was this problem, there exists this problem. Here's

10
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:31,540
what people previously did, here's why it's not any

11
00:00:31,540 --> 00:00:34,910
good. We did this, here's what we found

12
00:00:34,910 --> 00:00:37,670
and like that's the end. So there's this sort

13
00:00:37,670 --> 00:00:40,420
of like there's this narrative arrow that goes

14
00:00:40,420 --> 00:00:45,810
through it. and, so that's one and number 2,

15
00:00:45,810 --> 00:00:47,210
I guess the other tip that I would have

16
00:00:47,210 --> 00:00:50,550
is think about your audience. Who is your audience?

17
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:54,280
Are your audience is your audience technically oriented, or

18
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:58,190
are they not technically oriented? Is your goal basically, is

19
00:00:58,190 --> 00:00:59,490
your, are you trying, is it a bunch of

20
00:00:59,490 --> 00:01:01,430
people that you're trying to recruit to come and join

21
00:01:01,430 --> 00:01:04,519
you, in which case maybe you want to show

22
00:01:04,519 --> 00:01:09,890
them like cool demos. Or are they you know, just

23
00:01:09,890 --> 00:01:13,420
just like a, a room full of your hard-nosed science

24
00:01:13,420 --> 00:01:17,090
colleagues who are just going to brutally scrutinize whatever you present

25
00:01:17,090 --> 00:01:20,880
to them in which case, you may want to do something else.
