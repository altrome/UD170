1
00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:02,100
All right, let's walk through the solution to

2
00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:04,680
this guy. It's a pretty straightforward one line

3
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:08,940
solution. We simply say baseball weight equals baseball

4
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:14,370
weight.fillna numpy.mean baseball weight. What we're doing here

5
00:00:14,370 --> 00:00:16,120
is saying let's compute the mean of all

6
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:20,040
the existing non NA values in baseball weight.

7
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:22,420
Then let's take all the NA's in baseball

8
00:00:22,420 --> 00:00:24,860
weight. And replace them with this mean value.

9
00:00:25,930 --> 00:00:28,740
Let's take the baseball weight column, and replace it with

10
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:32,259
this new column, which doesn't have any NA values in it.
