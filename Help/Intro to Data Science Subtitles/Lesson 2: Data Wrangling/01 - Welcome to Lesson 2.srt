Welcome to the second lesson of Introduction to Data

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:05,630
Science. In the first lesson, we discussed data science at

3
00:00:05,630 --> 00:00:08,730
a high level. So we talked about the skills that

4
00:00:08,730 --> 00:00:11,590
a data scientist usually has, and also some of the

5
00:00:11,590 --> 00:00:14,960
problems that you can solve using data science. One

6
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:17,340
of the most important skills that a data scientist can

7
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:21,050
have, is the ability to extract and clean data. This

8
00:00:21,050 --> 00:00:25,190
is usually referred to as data wrangling or data munching.

9
00:00:25,190 --> 00:00:27,430
Believe it or not, some data scientists say that they

10
00:00:27,430 --> 00:00:31,410
can spend up to 70% of their time data wrangling. This

11
00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:34,070
may sound crazy to you, but it's not hard to imagine

12
00:00:34,070 --> 00:00:37,530
this happening. Let's say you have some really cool analysis project

13
00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:39,680
that you want to do. Say, look at a variety of

14
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:43,630
factors, and figure out why the life expectancy in City A

15
00:00:43,630 --> 00:00:47,220
is higher than City B. Well okay, let's say that all

16
00:00:47,220 --> 00:00:50,260
this data lives on a website. So, you write some scripts

17
00:00:50,260 --> 00:00:53,920
to go and pull this data from the website. Great, but

18
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:57,935
then you need somewhere to store the data, so you're going

19
00:00:57,935 --> 00:01:00,840
to need a database. So okay, we, we use a database,

20
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:03,180
we store all the data there. And then you look at

21
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:05,209
the data and you realize, oh wait, there are a bunch

22
00:01:05,209 --> 00:01:08,220
of missing values, or a bunch of this data looks weird.

23
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:11,540
So you need to develop some, some method to take all

24
00:01:11,540 --> 00:01:15,300
this data and clean it up. This is data munching. And all

25
00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:16,770
of this is necessary if we want to

26
00:01:16,770 --> 00:01:20,090
answer our original really cool question. Why is the

27
00:01:20,090 --> 00:01:23,010
life expectancy in city A, higher than the life

28
00:01:23,010 --> 00:01:26,940
expectancy in city B? In this lesson, we'll discuss

29
00:01:26,940 --> 00:01:30,240
data munching basics using 3 data sets. One

30
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:32,550
containing information on a bunch of baseball players, called

31
00:01:32,550 --> 00:01:37,172
the Lawmen baseball database. Another containing information on enrollments

32
00:01:37,172 --> 00:01:40,396
in an Indian identification program called Aadhar, and also

33
00:01:40,396 --> 00:01:44,480
data from the last FM API. Using these 3 data sets, we're going

34
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:48,080
to discuss the formats that data can come in, how you can acquire data

35
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:52,170
from these various data sources, and also how to inspects the data and see

36
00:01:52,170 --> 00:01:53,920
if it might have any missing or

37
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:57,020
erroneous values. Alright, well let's get started.
