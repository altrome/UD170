By now you've realized that data is often messy

2
00:00:02,490 --> 00:00:05,730
and unorganized. Because of that, a large amount of a

3
00:00:05,730 --> 00:00:08,450
data scientist's time is spent extracting and cleaning the

4
00:00:08,450 --> 00:00:10,980
data that they will use to perform analyses or make

5
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:14,730
visualizations. Let's get our feet wet and first discuss

6
00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:17,510
the various ways that we might load our data. If

7
00:00:17,510 --> 00:00:20,730
we want to programmatically process and analyze our data, it's

8
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:23,810
very important to understand the structure of the data itself.
