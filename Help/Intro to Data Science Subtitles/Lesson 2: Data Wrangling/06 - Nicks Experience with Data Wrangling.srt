00:00:01,350 --> 00:00:04,800
The did it, that also will, depend on the project

2
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:05,736
>> Say that one more time.

3
00:00:05,736 --> 00:00:12,550
>> On average, over 50% of the time it's just kind of. Well, maybe be spent

4
00:00:12,550 --> 00:00:15,890
like, combing through the data and like just,

5
00:00:15,890 --> 00:00:19,420
figuring out maybe idiosyncrasies in it. And You know.

6
00:00:19,420 --> 00:00:21,380
You quickly apply an algorithm, you look at

7
00:00:21,380 --> 00:00:22,750
it. You don't get the results you expect,

8
00:00:22,750 --> 00:00:24,250
so you dig in a little closer and

9
00:00:24,250 --> 00:00:26,350
like see that there are these weird little kind

10
00:00:26,350 --> 00:00:28,670
of edge cases that are, are ending up more

11
00:00:28,670 --> 00:00:30,630
prominent in your data than you previously expected. So,

12
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:33,090
you have to go back and scrape and comb

13
00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:36,920
through it again, and it's just this iterative back-and-forth process.
