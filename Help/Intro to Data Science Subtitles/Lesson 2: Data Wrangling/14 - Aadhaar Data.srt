To illustrate concepts with relational databases, we're going to use some data

0:00:04.040,0:00:08.805
on the Aadhaar program, that is acquired from India's online Open Data Portal.

0:00:08.805,0:00:11.730
Aadhaar is a relatively, new initiative in India.

0:00:11.730,0:00:13.930
It is a 12 digit, unique number that,

0:00:13.930,0:00:17.310
enables identification for every resident of India.

0:00:17.310,0:00:19.020
According, to the Indian government.

0:00:19.020,0:00:23.780
Once instituted, the Aadhaar will provide a universal identity infrastructure,

0:00:23.780,0:00:27.130
which can be used by any identity-based application.

0:00:27.130,0:00:30.710
The dataset, we'll be using describes the number of people, who enrolled in or

0:00:30.710,0:00:32.970
were rejected by the Aadhaar program.

0:00:32.970,0:00:37.620
Cut by various characteristics, such as district, subdistrict, gender, and

0:00:37.620,0:00:39.870
age across India.

0:00:39.870,0:00:43.510
As data scientists, the Aadhaar program is interesting to us, because it is

0:00:43.510,0:00:48.710
a huge dataset, representing one of the most significant populations on Earth.

0:00:48.710,0:00:51.610
We can study the Aadhaar enrollment dataset to learn a bit more about

0:00:51.610,0:00:52.900
India's population.

0:00:52.900,0:00:55.650
And also, what type of people are applying for and

0:00:55.650,0:00:57.680
successfully enrolling in the Aadhaar program.
