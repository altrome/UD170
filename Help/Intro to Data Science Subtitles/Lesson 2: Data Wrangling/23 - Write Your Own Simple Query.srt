1
00:00:00,590 --> 00:00:02,200
Alright, why don't we walk through a query

2
00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:04,780
that will generate the correct results? Note that

3
00:00:04,780 --> 00:00:06,570
we select the two columns that we want

4
00:00:06,570 --> 00:00:12,070
from the table, registrar and enrollment_agency, from aadhaar_data.

5
00:00:12,070 --> 00:00:15,250
In order to get only the first 50 rows, we add a LIMIT 50 to the

6
00:00:15,250 --> 00:00:17,710
end of our query. So the correct query

7
00:00:17,710 --> 00:00:23,418
is SELECT registrar, enrollment agency FROM aadhaar_data, LIMIT 50.
