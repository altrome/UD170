00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:03,965
Inserting the row, Madhya Pradesh, 28, 50.0, 60

2
00:00:03,965 --> 00:00:06,970
into our aadhaar table would be allowed, despite the

3
00:00:06,970 --> 00:00:09,560
fact that it's sort of gibberish. Madhya Pradesh's

4
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:12,980
size will be stored as 50.0 square kilometers and

5
00:00:12,980 --> 00:00:15,870
it's population would be stored as 60. The

6
00:00:15,870 --> 00:00:18,580
interesting thing here is that the capital would be

7
00:00:18,580 --> 00:00:22,920
stored as 28, a string which doesn't really make

8
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:25,570
much sense. But, in any case, the data would

9
00:00:25,570 --> 00:00:29,110
still be stored. You should always be careful to define the data

10
00:00:29,110 --> 00:00:33,930
types for your columns in a sensible way. For example, storing numbers as

11
00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:36,030
strings is problematic. Since it disallows

12
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:37,980
us from doing numerical computations on

13
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:42,560
the column. For example, taking the average value or finding the minimum value.
