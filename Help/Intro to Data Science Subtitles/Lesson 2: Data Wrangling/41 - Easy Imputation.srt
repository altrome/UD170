Let's first discuss what would seem to be the

0:00:02.840,0:00:05.310
easiest way to impute a missing value in our data

0:00:05.310,0:00:08.180
set. Just take the mean of our other data

0:00:08.180,0:00:12.960
points and fill in the missing values. So, for example,

0:00:12.960,0:00:15.720
let's say that Ichiro Suzuki and Babe Ruth are

0:00:15.720,0:00:19.760
missing values for weight in our baseball data set. Well,

0:00:19.760,0:00:22.670
okay, no problem. We can just take the mean

0:00:22.670,0:00:25.686
of all other players weights and assign that value to

0:00:25.686,0:00:28.170
Ichiro and Babe Ruth. In this case, we

0:00:28.170,0:00:30.610
would assign Ichiro and Babe Ruth both a weight

0:00:30.610,0:00:35.420
of 191.67. Wow, that seems really easy, right?

0:00:35.420,0:00:38.600
There's gotta be a catch. Well, let's first discuss

0:00:38.600,0:00:41.380
what's good about this method. We don't change

0:00:41.380,0:00:43.940
the mean of the height across our sample, That's

0:00:43.940,0:00:46.360
good. But let's say we were hoping to

0:00:46.360,0:00:50.590
study the relationship between weight and birth year. Or

0:00:50.590,0:00:53.440
height and weight. Just plugging the mean height into a bunch of our

0:00:53.440,0:00:56.040
data points lessens the correlation between

0:00:56.040,0:00:58.780
our imputed variable and any other variable.
