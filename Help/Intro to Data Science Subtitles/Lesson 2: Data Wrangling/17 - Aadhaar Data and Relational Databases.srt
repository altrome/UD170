00:00:00,670 --> 00:00:02,460
How does the Aadhaar data fit into the

2
00:00:02,460 --> 00:00:06,110
definition of relational database that we just covered? In

3
00:00:06,110 --> 00:00:08,090
the case of the Aadhaar data, our database would

4
00:00:08,090 --> 00:00:11,470
have just one table called Aadhaar Data. It has

5
00:00:11,470 --> 00:00:16,400
numerous columns for example, registrar, enrollment agency, state,

6
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:19,320
district, and a number of others. We can imagine

7
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:21,850
a related table might have information on all the

8
00:00:21,850 --> 00:00:25,310
Indian districts such as their populations and their size.
