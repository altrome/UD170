00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:05,800
Now, let's put everything together. Let's use last.fm's geo.gettopartists

2
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:08,164
API call to write a short program to find the

3
00:00:08,164 --> 00:00:11,830
top-performing artist in Spain. Here's a hint, on the

4
00:00:11,830 --> 00:00:13,810
page here it shows that we have to pass in

5
00:00:13,810 --> 00:00:16,900
the country parameter. Also, you may want to use

6
00:00:16,900 --> 00:00:19,000
the JSON library so it will be easier for you

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,080
to read the JSON data. If you need to register

8
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:25,450
for your own API key, you can do so here.

9
00:00:25,450 --> 00:00:27,230
Your code should go into this space.
