Another method that we could use to impute missing

0:00:02.640,0:00:05.700
values in a data set is to perform linear regression

0:00:05.700,0:00:09.320
to estimate the missing values. We'll cover linear regression

0:00:09.320,0:00:12.080
in more depth in the next lesson. But the general

0:00:12.080,0:00:14.770
idea is that we would create an equation that

0:00:14.770,0:00:18.060
predicts missing values in the data using information we do

0:00:18.060,0:00:21.080
have, and then use that equation to fill in our

0:00:21.080,0:00:25.670
missing values. Okay so, what are the drawbacks of using

0:00:25.670,0:00:29.480
this linear regression type technique? Well, one negative

0:00:29.480,0:00:31.690
side effect of imputing missing values in this

0:00:31.690,0:00:34.600
way is that we would over emphasize existing

0:00:34.600,0:00:37.580
trends in the data. For example, if, if

0:00:37.580,0:00:39.740
there is a relationship between date of birth

0:00:39.740,0:00:42.390
and height in MLB players, all of our

0:00:42.390,0:00:47.300
imputed values will amplify this trend. Additionally, this

0:00:47.300,0:00:50.940
model will produce exact values for the missing entries,

0:00:50.940,0:00:53.690
which would suggest a greater certainty in the missing values than

0:00:53.690,0:00:57.500
we actually have. In any case, let's say we did want

0:00:57.500,0:00:59.790
to fill in the missing values for weight in our baseball

0:00:59.790,0:01:03.580
player data. We could train a linear model using the existing

0:01:03.580,0:01:06.890
data that we have, and then use that model to fill

0:01:06.890,0:01:09.842
in these missing values. Let's say we did want to fill

0:01:09.842,0:01:12.438
in the missing values for weight in our baseball data. We

0:01:12.438,0:01:15.949
could train a linear model using our existing data. That is,

0:01:15.949,0:01:19.009
entries that have position, left or right

0:01:19.009,0:01:23.599
handed batter, average, birthdate, deathdate, height and

0:01:23.599,0:01:25.779
weight. And then use that model that

0:01:25.779,0:01:28.410
we've created to fill in these missing values.
