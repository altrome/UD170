Alright, we've shown you how to load some data

0:00:02.110,0:00:05.230
into pandas from a CSV file. Now, let's see if

0:00:05.230,0:00:07.930
you can load a csv into python and manipulate the

0:00:07.930,0:00:11.220
data in a basic way. What we've provided here is

0:00:11.220,0:00:13.720
the skeleton of a function called add full name, which

0:00:13.720,0:00:19.760
takes in two arguments, path_to_csv and path_to_new_csv. Assume you'll be

0:00:19.760,0:00:22.030
reading in a CSV file with the same columns as

0:00:22.030,0:00:25.590
the Lahman baseball data set. Most importantly, there are columns

0:00:25.590,0:00:29.460
called, nameFirst and nameLast. Write a function that

0:00:29.460,0:00:32.470
reads the CSV located at path_to_csv into a

0:00:32.470,0:00:35.130
pandas dataframe, and then adds a new column

0:00:35.130,0:00:39.470
called nameFull, with that player's full name. For example,

0:00:39.470,0:00:41.940
in the row corresponding to Hank Aaron, nameFull

0:00:41.940,0:00:45.070
would be Hank Aaron. After that, write the

0:00:45.070,0:00:46.970
data in the Pandas dataFrame to a new

0:00:46.970,0:00:51.090
CSV, located at path_to_new_csv. Your code should go here.
