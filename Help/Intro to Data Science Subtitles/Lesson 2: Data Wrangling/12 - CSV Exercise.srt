00:00:00,750 --> 00:00:02,642
Alright, let's walk through the solution to this

2
00:00:02,642 --> 00:00:06,900
assessment. First, we import the pandas module, then

3
00:00:06,900 --> 00:00:10,300
we read in the csv located at path_to_csv,

4
00:00:10,300 --> 00:00:13,270
using the pandas read_csv function. Then we're going to

5
00:00:13,270 --> 00:00:15,484
create a new column in the dataframe called

6
00:00:15,484 --> 00:00:19,080
nameFull, which is the concatenation of the nameFirst column,

7
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:22,460
a space, and the nameLast column. Finally, we're

8
00:00:22,460 --> 00:00:25,800
going to use pandas to_csv function, to write the

9
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:30,947
new data frame to a new csv file located at path_to_new_csv.
