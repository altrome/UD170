1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:02,320
Alright, now let's say we have a bunch of our

2
00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:06,700
data in a relational database. Your next question is probably,

3
00:00:06,700 --> 00:00:08,640
how do we get it out? And what can we

4
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:11,990
do with it? Well, let's try to learn about this

5
00:00:11,990 --> 00:00:16,040
using our aadhaar data. Now, data is usually retrieved from

6
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:18,800
a relational database using one of a family of languages

7
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:22,240
that I'll call SQL like languages. Well, there are some

8
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:25,210
small variations between the languages. They have the same general

9
00:00:25,210 --> 00:00:29,530
concepts and syntax. Now, how could we query

10
00:00:29,530 --> 00:00:32,439
the Aadhaar enrollment data set with SQL like syntax,

11
00:00:32,439 --> 00:00:34,489
if data was in a database. Stored in a

12
00:00:34,489 --> 00:00:38,740
table called Aadhaar data. Well, the most simple thing

13
00:00:38,740 --> 00:00:43,222
that we might want to do is simply to select all of the data, that is, all rows

14
00:00:43,222 --> 00:00:45,376
and columns. If we wanted to do that, we

15
00:00:45,376 --> 00:00:50,060
could type something like select star from aadhaar data.

16
00:00:50,060 --> 00:00:53,300
Note that the SQL syntax is pretty human readable. We're

17
00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:57,420
just saying we want to select star or everything from

18
00:00:57,420 --> 00:00:59,860
the aadhaar data table. If we were to run this

19
00:00:59,860 --> 00:01:03,750
command as is, we would produce tens of thousands of rows

20
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:06,840
which is probably not super constructive right now. So what

21
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:09,230
we can do is, limit the number of rows by just

22
00:01:09,230 --> 00:01:12,960
saying limit 20 at the end of our SQL command.

23
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:16,180
If we ran this query, let's see what we get back.

24
00:01:16,180 --> 00:01:17,940
Oh, great, the first 20 rows of

25
00:01:17,940 --> 00:01:20,820
the data. These are rows describing enrollments for

26
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:24,430
the registrar Allahabad Bank, with various enrollment agencies,

27
00:01:24,430 --> 00:01:28,670
districts, age, genders, et cetera. Now, say we

28
00:01:28,670 --> 00:01:31,070
only wanted some of these columns. Say,

29
00:01:31,070 --> 00:01:34,200
district and subdistrict. We could just ask for

30
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:37,672
those specific columns instead of star. For example,

31
00:01:37,672 --> 00:01:41,624
we might write, select district, subdistrict from aadhaar

32
00:01:41,624 --> 00:01:42,921
data, limit 20.
