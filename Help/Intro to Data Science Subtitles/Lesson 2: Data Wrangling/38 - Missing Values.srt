1
00:00:00,668 --> 00:00:03,500
One explanation for missing data is that something maybe

2
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:07,340
failing occasionally when collecting your data. For example, if

3
00:00:07,340 --> 00:00:10,310
you were conducting a traditional door to door survey,

4
00:00:10,310 --> 00:00:13,780
maybe the person handling the documents looses a few, or

5
00:00:13,780 --> 00:00:16,149
tends to miss some streets at random because they

6
00:00:16,149 --> 00:00:18,950
don't know the geography of your town very well.

7
00:00:18,950 --> 00:00:21,200
This is a case of a researcher or collection

8
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:25,900
technique causing missing data. The offline example of someone conducting

9
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:29,270
a traditional door-to-door survey can easily be translated to

10
00:00:29,270 --> 00:00:33,470
the digital world. Imagine your data collection software fails one

11
00:00:33,470 --> 00:00:35,910
out of every 1,000 times, or you have a

12
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:39,950
couple of service outages. You could have similar data loss.

13
00:00:39,950 --> 00:00:41,590
If this were to happen in our baseball player

14
00:00:41,590 --> 00:00:44,680
data set, we might see some missing values here and

15
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:46,880
there, just because we made some error in collecting

16
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:51,000
them at random. Another more harmful reason values may be

17
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,160
missing is referred to as non response. In

18
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:56,550
the case of non response, a certain subset of

19
00:00:56,550 --> 00:00:59,890
people chooses not to answer particular questions. Or

20
00:00:59,890 --> 00:01:02,560
don't respond at all. This can lead to biases

21
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:06,690
in your data and consequently, false conclusions. In

22
00:01:06,690 --> 00:01:09,220
the case of baseball data, say we were interested

23
00:01:09,220 --> 00:01:12,710
in the batting average of players. Maybe, since

24
00:01:12,710 --> 00:01:16,060
they're, I don't know, self-conscious about their batting average.

25
00:01:16,060 --> 00:01:19,510
All outfielders just don't provide a value. This would

26
00:01:19,510 --> 00:01:21,700
make our results inaccurate and lead us to conclude

27
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:24,950
that the average batting average was 312 even though

28
00:01:24,950 --> 00:01:28,530
that is based only one data point here, Derek Jeter's.

29
00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:31,420
The important point here is this, if the missing

30
00:01:31,420 --> 00:01:34,160
values from your data are distributed at random. Your

31
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:37,970
data may still be representative of the population. However,

32
00:01:37,970 --> 00:01:42,630
if values are missing systematically, it could invalidate your findings.

33
00:01:42,630 --> 00:01:44,410
It's important to design your experiment or

34
00:01:44,410 --> 00:01:47,940
data collection method to minimize these effects. Beyond

35
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:51,480
this, it's very important to check your data to see if such effects are present.
