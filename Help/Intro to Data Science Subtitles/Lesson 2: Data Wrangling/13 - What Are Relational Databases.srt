We've talked about loading data from flat files by way of CSV, but a lot of the

0:00:04.640,0:00:07.320
time, the data that data scientists work with

0:00:07.320,0:00:11.340
are stored in relational databases. A relational database is

0:00:11.340,0:00:14.180
similar to a collection of spreadsheets. In each

0:00:14.180,0:00:18.180
spreadsheet, there are columns and rows. A column specifies

0:00:18.180,0:00:20.660
a value and its type such as player ID

0:00:20.660,0:00:25.330
or team ID or record. Each row contains values

0:00:25.330,0:00:28.465
for each column such as 1 or 1 or

0:00:28.465,0:00:33.240
245-150. Or 1 and Yankees, things like that. In

0:00:33.240,0:00:35.450
the database world, we call each set of rows

0:00:35.450,0:00:38.960
and columns a table rather than a spreadsheet. And the

0:00:38.960,0:00:41.160
tables are usually related to each other in some

0:00:41.160,0:00:44.880
way. It's very important to be somewhat familiar with relational

0:00:44.880,0:00:48.170
databases. Since they're used in so many places and

0:00:48.170,0:00:50.550
also since we'll be storing some of the data required

0:00:50.550,0:00:54.140
for our class project in a small database. Let's take some time and talk

0:00:54.140,0:00:55.870
briefly about how one can store and

0:00:55.870,0:00:58.980
retrieve data from relational databases. In this

0:00:58.980,0:01:00.920
course, we won't discuss the design of

0:01:00.920,0:01:05.129
databases. Topics like normalization, indices, keys, things

0:01:05.129,0:01:09.270
like that. Some of these topics will be covered in Data Wrangling with Mongo DB.
