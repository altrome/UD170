Relational databases always have a schema. What is

2
00:00:04,310 --> 00:00:07,210
a schema? In layman's terms a schema is

3
00:00:07,210 --> 00:00:09,480
a blueprint that tells the database how we

4
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:13,370
plan to store our data. More specifically, a schema

5
00:00:13,370 --> 00:00:16,270
basically says that for a given table, every

6
00:00:16,270 --> 00:00:19,330
single row or entry will have the exact same

7
00:00:19,330 --> 00:00:22,870
number of columns that correspond to the same

8
00:00:22,870 --> 00:00:26,030
values and that each column's value will be formatted

9
00:00:26,030 --> 00:00:30,340
in the same way. So, for example, in this table, I can say that there are

10
00:00:30,340 --> 00:00:34,830
four columns: district name, capital city, size, and

11
00:00:34,830 --> 00:00:38,440
population. District name and capital city might always be

12
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:41,370
strings, where size might be a float, and

13
00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:45,210
population might be an int. This list of columns

14
00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:47,000
and their requirements on how their values are

15
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,120
formatted define the schema for this table. Now let's

16
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:53,329
add some entries to the table. Let's say

17
00:00:53,329 --> 00:00:56,769
the first [UNKNOWN] I wish to enter is corresponds

18
00:00:56,769 --> 00:01:01,585
to the district Gujarat which has 60,439,692 people,

19
00:01:01,585 --> 00:01:05,627
has an area of 196,024 square kilometers and has

20
00:01:05,627 --> 00:01:09,270
a capital city of Gandhinagar. All of these

21
00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:12,040
entries fit the schema, so inserting this row into

22
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:14,100
the table is fine. Now, let's say I

23
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:16,620
had another I wish to add, the Maharashtra district,

24
00:01:16,620 --> 00:01:19,530
which has a capital city of Mumbai, and I provide no

25
00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:22,890
other values. This would also be allowed, but for all columns for

26
00:01:22,890 --> 00:01:25,760
which I don't specify values, the value would either be set

27
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:29,450
to null or default values that are stored in the table definition.
