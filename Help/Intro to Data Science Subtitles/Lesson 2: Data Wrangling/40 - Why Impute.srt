1
00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:03,620
In scenarios where we don't have very much data, or

2
00:00:03,620 --> 00:00:06,910
where removing our missing values would compromise the representativeness of

3
00:00:06,910 --> 00:00:09,530
our sample, it might not make sense to throw away

4
00:00:09,530 --> 00:00:12,780
a bunch of our entries just because they're missing values.

5
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:16,230
This could severely impact the statistical power of whatever analysis

6
00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:19,460
we were trying to perform. In this case, it likely

7
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:21,700
makes sense to make an intelligent guess at the missing

8
00:00:21,700 --> 00:00:25,710
values in our data. The process of approximating these missing

9
00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:29,000
values is referred to as imputation. There are many

10
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,910
different ways to impute missing values. And different techniques

11
00:00:31,910 --> 00:00:35,470
are constantly being developed. I want to quickly discuss

12
00:00:35,470 --> 00:00:38,280
some relatively simple ways to impute missing values in our

13
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:41,570
data. Let's note that imputation is a really hard

14
00:00:41,570 --> 00:00:44,390
problem. Each of the methods we'll discuss introduce a

15
00:00:44,390 --> 00:00:48,530
certain biases or inaccuracies into your data set. We're

16
00:00:48,530 --> 00:00:51,450
discussing some of the most simple ways to impute data,

17
00:00:51,450 --> 00:00:54,610
but much more sophisticated and robust methods are out there.
