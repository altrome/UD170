1
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:02,870
So let's say that there are missing values

2
00:00:02,870 --> 00:00:06,110
in your data and they're distributed at random. What

3
00:00:06,110 --> 00:00:08,920
do we do? There are two approaches that I

4
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:13,660
want to discuss here, partial deletion and impution. Partial

5
00:00:13,660 --> 00:00:16,580
deletion is exactly what it sounds like, limiting our

6
00:00:16,580 --> 00:00:18,710
data set for analysis to the data that we

7
00:00:18,710 --> 00:00:23,450
have available to us. Let's discuss partial deletion further.

8
00:00:23,450 --> 00:00:25,790
For the following discussion let's use the Sean Lawman

9
00:00:25,790 --> 00:00:29,050
database of baseball players. There are a number of

10
00:00:29,050 --> 00:00:32,119
players for whom many values are missing. Now let's

11
00:00:32,119 --> 00:00:33,780
say that we wanted to ask a couple of

12
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:38,300
different questions. For example what are the average life span

13
00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:41,800
and average height of baseball players? There are many

14
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:45,050
players that we can't include in the analysis, either because

15
00:00:45,050 --> 00:00:47,620
their birth date or death date is missing, or

16
00:00:47,620 --> 00:00:50,800
because they're still alive. In this case, we may want

17
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:53,560
to perform partial deletion. One method we could

18
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:57,000
use is called Listwise Deletion. In the case

19
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,080
where we perform Listwise Deletion, we'd exclude a

20
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:03,120
particular data point from all analyses even if

21
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:06,070
some useful values were present. So if using

22
00:01:06,070 --> 00:01:09,160
Listwise Deletion, Barry Bonds, who has a listed

23
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:12,460
height, but not death date, would not be

24
00:01:12,460 --> 00:01:15,850
included in either analysis, even if we were calculating

25
00:01:15,850 --> 00:01:19,590
the average height of players. On the other hand,

26
00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:22,149
in the case where we might perform Pairwise Deletion,

27
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:25,840
we would exclude a particular case from the analysis

28
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:28,030
for tasks which are not possible with the data

29
00:01:28,030 --> 00:01:31,170
at hand. So we wouldn't include Barry Bonds in

30
00:01:31,170 --> 00:01:33,940
our sample when calculating life span since there's no

31
00:01:33,940 --> 00:01:36,500
death date, but we would still use his height

32
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:38,984
when calculating the average height of all baseball players.
