The coolest one I've worked on so far. The

0:00:02.650,0:00:06.770
one that I there are several that we've done kind

0:00:06.770,0:00:08.790
of, on the team. But the one that sort of

0:00:08.790,0:00:12.430
seemed most flushed out and seemed kind of have the

0:00:12.430,0:00:14.550
best effect within the company thus far is the

0:00:14.550,0:00:18.660
we made a coaching dashboard for the course managers, to

0:00:18.660,0:00:21.210
kind of assign each student a risk index, which

measures You know, roughly, like it looks at various features

0:00:25.140,0:00:27.500
related to this, you know, behavior and usage of the site and tries

0:00:27.500,0:00:31.280

0:00:31.280,0:00:36.450
of that, a sort of urgency index which then tracks sort of changes in risk

0:00:36.450,0:00:41.390
and allows one to in theory kind of group students into trends.
