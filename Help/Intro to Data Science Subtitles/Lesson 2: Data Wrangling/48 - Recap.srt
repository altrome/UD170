00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:02,790
To recap, over the course of this lesson we've discussed

2
00:00:02,790 --> 00:00:05,790
a bunch of the basic skills required to do data wrangling

3
00:00:05,790 --> 00:00:08,860
or data munching. So we've discussed some of the formats

4
00:00:08,860 --> 00:00:12,670
that data might come in. Such as CSV, [UNKNOWN], and xml.

5
00:00:12,670 --> 00:00:14,720
We've also talked about how to get this data from

6
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:18,820
a variety of sources. Such as SQL like databases, flat files,

7
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:22,090
and API's. We've also talked about how to look at the

8
00:00:22,090 --> 00:00:25,460
data, see if things look all right, and if they don't,

9
00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:27,880
some of the methods to mitigate these problems, such

10
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:31,410
as data imputation. Over the course of doing these

11
00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:35,190
basic acquisition and cleaning tasks, you'll usually discover some

12
00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:38,640
basic things about your data. But you might also want

13
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:41,460
to do some more sophisticated analysis to learn some

14
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:44,210
more subtle things about your data set. That's what

15
00:00:44,210 --> 00:00:46,150
we'll learn in the next lesson, and then we'll

16
00:00:46,150 --> 00:00:48,320
apply those insights to the New York City subway data.
