Often acquiring data to do analysis doesn't require

2
00:00:03,490 --> 00:00:06,900
any particularly fancy methodology. It's just a matter of

3
00:00:06,900 --> 00:00:08,810
finding the right file somewhere on the internet

4
00:00:08,810 --> 00:00:11,010
and downloading it. A lot of the data that

5
00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:14,320
exists out there, particularly on government websites, is

6
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:17,280
stored in text files. For example, let's say we

7
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:21,650
wanted to get a database of all major league baseball statistics. I kind find

8
00:00:21,650 --> 00:00:28,910
this data at http://www.SeanLahman.com/baseballarchives/statistics.

9
00:00:28,910 --> 00:00:31,930
If I visit this website, I can see that

10
00:00:31,930 --> 00:00:33,870
the data I want is available in a variety

11
00:00:33,870 --> 00:00:37,860
of formats. A comma delimited or CSV version, but

12
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:41,020
also a Microsoft Access version, and a SQL version.
