I want to highlight another thing. Let's look at this

2
00:00:03,580 --> 00:00:07,660
data. It looks kind of, strange, right? This data's actually

3
00:00:07,660 --> 00:00:10,820
in JSON format. The same JSON that we discussed

4
00:00:10,820 --> 00:00:14,390
earlier in this class. As I insinuated earlier, we can

5
00:00:14,390 --> 00:00:16,650
kind of, think of JSON data as a Python

6
00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:20,110
dictionary. Let's make this data easier to read and I'll

7
00:00:20,110 --> 00:00:22,410
show you what I mean. See how each piece

8
00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:25,720
of data in this JSON object corresponds to a key,

9
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:30,550
very much how like every value in a Python dictionary corresponds to a key. So

10
00:00:30,550 --> 00:00:35,530
our first key here is album. And the value is actually another JSON object. Here

11
00:00:35,530 --> 00:00:38,320
we have key name, value unapologetic, key

12
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:42,150
artist, value of Rihanna, and so on. Although

13
00:00:42,150 --> 00:00:45,760
JSON is not equivalent to Python dictionaries,

14
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:47,730
you can think of them as similar abstractions.
