00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:03,300
Now that you're equipped with some basic skills necessary to acquire

2
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:06,050
and clean up data, we'll use these tools in order to

3
00:00:06,050 --> 00:00:10,190
begin working on our class project, analyzing the dynamics and workings

4
00:00:10,190 --> 00:00:13,260
of the New York City subway system. First, you'll use your

5
00:00:13,260 --> 00:00:16,520
knowledge of how to acquire data via an API, to obtain

6
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:19,362
weather underground data on New York City, for a month in

7
00:00:19,362 --> 00:00:22,655
2011, and write it to a file. We'll then use our

8
00:00:22,655 --> 00:00:25,400
SQL skills to run some basic queries on the data and

9
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:26,680
get a sense from what our day looks

10
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:30,080
like. Once you're comfortable with the weather data, you'll

11
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:31,690
grab a bunch of data related to the

12
00:00:31,690 --> 00:00:35,410
MTA subway itself from the MTA website. In addition

13
00:00:35,410 --> 00:00:37,438
to gaining some basic familiarity with the MTA

14
00:00:37,438 --> 00:00:39,830
data, you'll do some processing and cleaning of that

15
00:00:39,830 --> 00:00:41,842
data. Such that it'll be very easy to do

16
00:00:41,842 --> 00:00:44,090
analysis on the data in the very near future.
