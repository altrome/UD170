Hello, my name is Nick Gustafson, and

0:00:02.530,0:00:06.430
I'm a data scientist at Udacity. My background

0:00:06.430,0:00:09.180
is I did my undergrad in neurobiology and

0:00:09.180,0:00:12.430
I went on in graduate school to continue

0:00:12.430,0:00:15.280
studying neurobiology, and neuroscience in particular, and

0:00:15.280,0:00:19.240
kind of, computational neuroscience and looking at algorithmic

0:00:19.240,0:00:22.750
And all mechanisms of learning and decision making.

0:00:22.750,0:00:25.420
And while towards that, hm, tail end of

0:00:25.420,0:00:28.970
my graduate work I, eventually kind of realized I did not want to stay

0:00:28.970,0:00:31.480
in academia, however I still have this

0:00:31.480,0:00:34.060
kind of strong passion for analyzing data,

0:00:34.060,0:00:36.950
modeling data, understanding You know, patterns within

0:00:36.950,0:00:38.190
it, and kind of, you know, applying

0:00:38.190,0:00:40.790
scientific methods, and data science just, just

0:00:40.790,0:00:42.580
felt like a natural progression from there.
