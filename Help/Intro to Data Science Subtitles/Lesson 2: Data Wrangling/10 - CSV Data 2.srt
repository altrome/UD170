1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:03,680
Now, say that I wanted to write my data to

2
00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:07,580
a new CSV file that included my new height plus

3
00:00:07,580 --> 00:00:11,080
weight column. Again, this is a simple one-line process using

4
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:14,240
Pandas. I can simply call the data frame objects to

5
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:17,220
CSV method, and provide as an argument the file name

6
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:19,120
of the file I wish to write to. In this

7
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:22,440
case, baseball data with weight height dot CSV. There are

8
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:25,450
a number of optional keyword arguments I could provide here beyond

9
00:00:25,450 --> 00:00:28,080
the file name. For example, if I wanted to use

10
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:30,890
a separator besides a comma, if I wanted to specify

11
00:00:30,890 --> 00:00:33,870
how to handle missing values, et cetera. You should check

12
00:00:33,870 --> 00:00:36,110
out the panda's documentation if you'd like to learn more.
