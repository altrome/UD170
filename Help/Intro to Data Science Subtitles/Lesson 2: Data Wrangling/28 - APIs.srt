00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:02,630
Previously, we've shown you how to access data that sits

2
00:00:02,630 --> 00:00:05,930
in a file or a database. But what do you do

3
00:00:05,930 --> 00:00:08,560
when you want to access data that sits in some website,

4
00:00:08,560 --> 00:00:12,240
like Twitter data? We could just go to twitter.com and search

5
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:15,280
for Udacity, but then we'd have to manually write down

6
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:18,080
all the data. We could try to rate a web crawler

7
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:21,400
to go through the pages HTML, but as you can imagine,

8
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:25,260
that could get kind of complicated. Luckily, many tech companies like

9
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:28,940
Twitter allow users and developers to access data directly

10
00:00:28,940 --> 00:00:32,210
in a simple, machine readable format. They do so

11
00:00:32,210 --> 00:00:35,940
through something called an Application Programming Interface, or API.

12
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:39,580
There are several different kinds of APIs, but one of

13
00:00:39,580 --> 00:00:41,910
the most common types, and the one used by

14
00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:47,080
Twitter, is a representational state transfer or REST API. I

15
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:48,750
know I sound like a broken record here, but

16
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:50,530
if you'd like to learn more about the nitty gritty

17
00:00:50,530 --> 00:00:55,030
behind REST APIs, I'd recommend you take the data wrangling class with MongoDB.
