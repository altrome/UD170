1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:02,640
Now that we have acquired our data, whether the

2
00:00:02,640 --> 00:00:07,740
informal flat file sequel like relational database, or an API,

3
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:09,260
you might think we are ready to dive in

4
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:12,960
and do some analysis. Alas, I am afraid, we are

5
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:16,090
not quite there yet. There can often be problems

6
00:00:16,090 --> 00:00:18,750
with our data. It might not be in a format

7
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:22,010
that allows us to easily perform the desired analysis,

8
00:00:22,010 --> 00:00:25,160
or maybe there's a bunch of bad or missing values.

9
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:27,620
In this next section, let's discuss how to deal

10
00:00:27,620 --> 00:00:29,660
with these issues so that we can get to the

11
00:00:29,660 --> 00:00:33,810
exciting part of any project, the analysis. Let's talk briefly

12
00:00:33,810 --> 00:00:36,640
about sanity checking our data. What does it mean to

13
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:40,970
sanity check data? Well, put briefly, if we're sanity checking

14
00:00:40,970 --> 00:00:43,900
data we want to quickly determine, does the data make

15
00:00:43,900 --> 00:00:47,330
sense? Is there a problem? Does the data look like

16
00:00:47,330 --> 00:00:50,240
I expect it to? There's a ton of work you

17
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:52,790
can do to sanity check your data. We can

18
00:00:52,790 --> 00:00:55,570
draw plots to visualize the data. You can run some

19
00:00:55,570 --> 00:00:58,930
basic analyses and tons of other things. I don't want

20
00:00:58,930 --> 00:01:01,450
to focus too much on this in this course. If

21
00:01:01,450 --> 00:01:04,030
you'd like to dive deep into the subject, I'd recommend

22
00:01:04,030 --> 00:01:07,800
taking you down to these exploratory data and analysis course.

23
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:11,160
However, to do just the bare amount of sanity checking,

24
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:14,680
Pandas DataFrames do have a useful method called the Scribe.
