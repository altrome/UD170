1
00:00:00,008 --> 00:00:04,270
Let's use last.fm's API as an example, and let's

2
00:00:04,270 --> 00:00:05,970
see how we can interact with it to get

3
00:00:05,970 --> 00:00:12,450
data and find out the top albums in the US, China, and Spain. As you can see on

4
00:00:12,450 --> 00:00:14,510
the left hand side here, there are a few

5
00:00:14,510 --> 00:00:17,480
different last.fm API methods that we can talk to

6
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:21,280
and retrieve information from. For example, let's check out

7
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:25,180
the album.getInfo method. As you can see this page

8
00:00:25,180 --> 00:00:27,120
tells us the type of data that the API

9
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:31,610
method will return like artist name, album name and

10
00:00:31,610 --> 00:00:35,260
a bunch of other information such as language or

11
00:00:35,260 --> 00:00:38,600
a music brains ID from the album. But the question

12
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:40,770
is now how do we actually get to this

13
00:00:40,770 --> 00:00:46,130
data from last fm's API. It's actually really simple. We

14
00:00:46,130 --> 00:00:47,890
can simply copy and paste a link like this

15
00:00:47,890 --> 00:00:50,280
into the web browser. And look at all the information

16
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:53,850
that last.fm returned to us. Okay, now I

17
00:00:53,850 --> 00:00:56,380
want to point out a few interesting things about the

18
00:00:56,380 --> 00:00:59,800
URL. See all the parts after the question

19
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:03,550
mark? That's how we define API parameters. Like the

20
00:01:03,550 --> 00:01:08,050
method. The API key, the artist name and

21
00:01:08,050 --> 00:01:09,540
the name of the album that you want data

22
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:12,240
for. So for example, if we wanted information

23
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:16,730
on a different Rihanna album, like the album Unapologetic,

24
00:01:16,730 --> 00:01:18,500
we could simply change the album parameter

25
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:22,670
here from Loud to Unapologetic. Let's see if

26
00:01:22,670 --> 00:01:25,260
that works. Look, we now have the

27
00:01:25,260 --> 00:01:28,470
data from Rihanna's album, Unapologetic. Pretty simple, huh?
