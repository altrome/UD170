1
00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:03,070
Alright, why don't you try writing a quick sequel query

2
00:00:03,070 --> 00:00:06,630
of your own on the India aadhaar data set. What we're

3
00:00:06,630 --> 00:00:09,150
going to do is read in an aadhaar data CSV

4
00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:12,240
to create a pandas data frame which can be queried using

5
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:15,970
sequel like syntax. We'll rename any columns that have spaces

6
00:00:15,970 --> 00:00:19,205
in them with underscores and set all characters to lower case.

7
00:00:19,205 --> 00:00:21,800
So if the columns names more closely resemble columns names

8
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:25,480
one might find in a table. Why don't you write query

9
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:27,500
that will select out the first 50 values

10
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:31,440
for registrar and enrollment agency in the aadhaar_data table.

11
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:33,800
Your queries should go here. So that's how we

12
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:35,850
pull all of the data out of SQL database.
