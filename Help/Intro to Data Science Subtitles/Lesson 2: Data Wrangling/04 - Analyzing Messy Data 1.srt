Before diving into the nitty-gritty details of data munching, I

2
00:00:03,660 --> 00:00:06,390
want to ask if you've ever had to analyze really messy

3
00:00:06,390 --> 00:00:10,470
or unorganized data? Even if you're not a data scientist, you've

4
00:00:10,470 --> 00:00:14,060
probably dealt with unwieldy data at some point in your life.

5
00:00:14,060 --> 00:00:15,960
Maybe you had trouble reading the receipts from a bake

6
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:18,690
sale you organized, or you tried to keep track of your

7
00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:22,590
personal budget in an Excel spreadsheet. What methods or tools did

8
00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:25,830
you use to make your life easier? Please share your experience

9
00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:28,900
with the class by typing your answer in the forum. I've added

10
00:00:28,900 --> 00:00:31,670
a link to the discussion thread for you in the instructor comments.
