00:00:00,890 --> 00:00:03,090
There are a number of different reasons why values

2
00:00:03,090 --> 00:00:05,660
may be missing from your data. But here are a

3
00:00:05,660 --> 00:00:09,560
couple that I think are particularly common or important.

4
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:12,540
So, the first is that occasional system errors may prevent

5
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:15,980
data from being recorded. Another reason that data may

6
00:00:15,980 --> 00:00:18,430
be missing, is that some sub set of subjects or

7
00:00:18,430 --> 00:00:22,820
event types are systematically missing certain data attributes. Or maybe

8
00:00:22,820 --> 00:00:26,260
missing entirely. Let's dive deeper into both of these reasons.

9
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:29,480
One explanation for missing data is

10
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:31,480
that something may be failing occasionally when

11
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:34,050
collecting data. For example, if you

12
00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:36,790
were conducting a traditional door-to-door survey, maybe

13
00:00:36,790 --> 00:00:40,270
the person handling the documents loses a few or tends to miss some

14
00:00:40,270 --> 00:00:43,180
streets at random because they don't know the geography of the town well.
