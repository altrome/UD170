Alright, why don't you try to impute some

0:00:02.800,0:00:06.030
values on your own. Pandas dataframes have a

0:00:06.030,0:00:11.660
method called fillna. Which take in a value and allow you to pass in a static

0:00:11.660,0:00:17.130
value to replace any NAs that exist in a dataframe or series. You can call this

0:00:17.130,0:00:21.648
function like so. Data frame column, fillna value.

0:00:21.648,0:00:25.810
Using the numpy.mean function, which calculates the mean of

0:00:25.810,0:00:28.050
an numpy array, why don't you impute any

0:00:28.050,0:00:30.400
missing values in our Lahman baseball data sets

0:00:30.400,0:00:33.000
weight column, by setting the missing values equal

0:00:33.000,0:00:35.650
to the average weight. Your code should go here.
