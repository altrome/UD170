00:00:00,680 --> 00:00:02,930
Let's discuss a couple of more complex things

2
00:00:02,930 --> 00:00:05,740
that we want to do. We may not always want

3
00:00:05,740 --> 00:00:11,000
to pull thousands of rows, or even the first 20 rows in order. Maybe we want a

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,570
specific subset of our data. For example, maybe

5
00:00:14,570 --> 00:00:17,420
we're interested in all data corresponding to the state

6
00:00:17,420 --> 00:00:20,710
Gujarat. In order to do that, we'd simply write,

7
00:00:20,710 --> 00:00:26,540
select star from aadhaar_data, where state equals Gujarat. Note

8
00:00:26,540 --> 00:00:30,190
that to limit our results, the where clause needs to go directly after the

9
00:00:30,190 --> 00:00:34,460
table name. SQL syntax really does mirror the way we might say things out

10
00:00:34,460 --> 00:00:40,260
loud very closely. Now, let's see what happens if we run this command. And

11
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:43,705
there you see, we have all the data where the state is equal to Gujarat.
