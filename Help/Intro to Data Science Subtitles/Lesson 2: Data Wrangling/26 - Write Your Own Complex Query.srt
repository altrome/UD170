1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:02,590
So now that we've discussed how to write slightly more

2
00:00:02,590 --> 00:00:06,400
complicated sequel queries, why don't you give it a try?

3
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:08,780
We're going to read in our aadhaar_data csv to a

4
00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:13,040
pandas dataframe. Afterwards, as we did before, we'll rename the

5
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:16,460
columns by replacing any spaces with underscores, and by setting

6
00:00:16,460 --> 00:00:19,540
all characters to lowercase. So that the column names more

7
00:00:19,540 --> 00:00:22,300
closely resemble column names you might find in a sequel

8
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:25,500
table. Can you write a sequel query that will select from

9
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:29,580
the odd hard data table? How many men, and how many women, over the age

10
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:32,170
of 50, have had aadharr generated for them

11
00:00:32,170 --> 00:00:35,440
in each district? Your query should go here.
