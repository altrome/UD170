You may ask yourself, what is data munching? Let's work

2
00:00:03,630 --> 00:00:07,370
through an example and demonstrate the concept to you. Imagine

3
00:00:07,370 --> 00:00:09,490
we're trying to figure out if right handed or left

4
00:00:09,490 --> 00:00:12,450
handed baseball players have a higher batting average and we're

5
00:00:12,450 --> 00:00:15,670
given this table of data to answer the question. Let's

6
00:00:15,670 --> 00:00:19,260
look at the table. Look, this value is incorrect. You

7
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:22,610
can't have a batting average greater than 1,000. Also, it

8
00:00:22,610 --> 00:00:25,270
looks like we don't have any left or right-handedness for

9
00:00:25,270 --> 00:00:28,490
Ichiro Suzuki. Data wrangling is the art of dealing

10
00:00:28,490 --> 00:00:31,850
with and or converting missing or ill-formatted data into

11
00:00:31,850 --> 00:00:35,510
a format that more easily lends itself to analysis.

12
00:00:35,510 --> 00:00:38,180
But before we can do that analysis, we first

13
00:00:38,180 --> 00:00:39,750
have to get the data that we want to

14
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:43,652
analyze. Three of the most common sources from which

15
00:00:43,652 --> 00:00:46,460
can get data are from files, from a database,

16
00:00:46,460 --> 00:00:50,360
or from websites through web APIs. We'll cover all three

17
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:51,430
of these in this lesson.
