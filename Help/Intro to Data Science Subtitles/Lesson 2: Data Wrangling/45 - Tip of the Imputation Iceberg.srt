1
00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:03,090
These methods are literally just the tip of the iceberg

2
00:00:03,090 --> 00:00:06,250
when it comes to data amputation. I wanted to make

3
00:00:06,250 --> 00:00:08,890
sure that you were exposed to the concept, but there

4
00:00:08,890 --> 00:00:11,850
are much more robust and sophisticated methods to fill in missing

5
00:00:11,850 --> 00:00:15,070
values in your data. Filling in the missing values on

6
00:00:15,070 --> 00:00:17,410
a data set by computing the mean of the field in

7
00:00:17,410 --> 00:00:21,290
question, or fitting a linear model, are somewhat effective and

8
00:00:21,290 --> 00:00:25,670
simplistic methods, but they can both have negative side effects and

9
00:00:25,670 --> 00:00:28,840
amplify or attenuate preexisting trends in your data.
