1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:03,410
The correct answer is SELECT gender,

2
00:00:03,410 --> 00:00:08,656
district, sum aadhaar_generated FROM aadhaar_data WHERE age

3
00:00:08,656 --> 00:00:14,827
> 50 GROUP BY gender, district. Let's talk through this query. First, we

4
00:00:14,827 --> 00:00:18,230
wanted to know how many men and women in each district had aadhaar

5
00:00:18,230 --> 00:00:21,530
generated. So we select gender, district

6
00:00:21,530 --> 00:00:25,780
and sum aadhaar_generated from the aadhaar_data table.

7
00:00:25,780 --> 00:00:29,050
Since we're using an aggregate function, we need to include a group by,

8
00:00:29,050 --> 00:00:31,380
with our non-aggregated fields, in this

9
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:35,190
case, district and gender. Finally, we want

10
00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:38,860
to limit this to men and women over the age of 50. So,

11
00:00:38,860 --> 00:00:44,031
we include the where clause, WHERE age > 50, after the table name.
